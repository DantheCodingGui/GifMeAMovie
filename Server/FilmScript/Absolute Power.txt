It is a study for\n    one of his paintings.\n\n', "\n    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,\n    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so\n    brilliantly.\n\n    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban\n    housewives are there too.\n\n    And one older man.\n\n    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly\n    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a\n    successful company executive.\n\n    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great\n    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss\n    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.\n\n    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this\n    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the\n    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --\n\n    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the\n    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.\n\n    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his\n    work a moment, shakes his head.\n\n", "               Don't give up.\n\n", '               I never do.\n\n', "               May I?\n\n    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts\n    thumbing through.\n\n    The sketchbook as the pages turn.\n\n    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The\n    hands are better.

Now, from that --\n\n\n', "\n      A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here\n      but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the\n      houses neat and well tended.\n\n      Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's\n      afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.\n\n\n", "\n      Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working\n      class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man\n      Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED.

Clean, well tended.\n      Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He\n      carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the\n      market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.\n', '\n', '\n    A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.\n    Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,\n    bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front\n    door.\n\n\n', '\n    as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,\n    lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food\n    away --\n\n\n', "\n    Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.\n    Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther\n    himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it\n    down.\n\n    A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley\n    sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on\n    another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan\n    cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.\n    Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.\n\n    Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a\n    photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little\n    girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands\n    alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at\n    them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.\n\n    Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks\n    out the window.\n\n\n", '\n    is visible.     Lovely.   Peaceful.\n\n\n', "\n    Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the\n    hands and eyes and faces --\n\n    -- we are looking at something totally different:   a\n    mansion.\n\n    HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.\n\n", '\n    PULL BACK to reveal --\n', '\n', "\n     In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.\n\n     But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we\n     are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and\n     power.\n\n     We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.\n     Totally deserted. Silence.\n\n     Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO\n     VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The\n     lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides\n     to a stop. Again, silence...\n\n     HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There\n     is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --\n\n\n", "\n     A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears\n     dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,\n     begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --\n\n     -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his\n     entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last\n     sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,\n     so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught\n     again.\n\n\n", "\n     The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a\n     backpack.\n\n     The night is cool.\n\n     He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is\n     a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't\n     gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.\n\n     One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,\n     in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.\n     He makes no sound at all.\n\n\n", '\n     Thick wood with reinforced steel.\n\n     Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens\n     it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer\n     of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a\n     key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the\n     instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:\n', '\n', '\n     The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts\n     to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down:\n     forty, thirty-nine, thirty --\n\n', '\n\n', '\n     -- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more\n     than six inches long --\n\n     -- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside\n     in the foyer next to the front door.\n\n     The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --\n\n', '\n\n', '\n     Thirty-one, thirty, twenty --\n\n', '\n\n', '\n     Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts\n     the security panel away.\n\n     The BEEPING sound is constant --\n\n     -- and getting louder.\n\n     A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It\n     has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to\n     find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.\n\n', '\n\n', '\n     Eighteen, seventeen --\n\n', '\n\n', '\n     probing with the wires into the heart of the security\n     panel.\n\n', '\n', "\n     The BEEPING is LOUDER still.\n\n     The security panel.

Then he's busy again,\n      unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work\n      quickly, precisely.\n\n\n", "\n      The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,\n      moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again\n      shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.\n\n      It's as if he hadn't been there at all...\n\n\n", "\n      Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the\n      vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it\n      looked in the moonlight.\n\n      A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past\n      it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a\n      late one, when the madness had him and things were\n      sliding away. Very sad.\n\n      Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --\n\n      -- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an\n      instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as\n      if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if\n      getting ready for his next museum session  --\n\n      -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the\n      third floor.\n\n\n", '\n      Here\'s a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an\n      overpowering sense of being alone --\n\n      -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"\n      moves on.\n\n\n', '\n      Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.\n\n      The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see\n      a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby\n      girl, the next one of the same child at three.\n\n      We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she\n      is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.\n', ')B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                          8.\n\n', '\n      Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,\n      if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl\n      you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.\n\n      These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy\n      Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a\n      shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.\n\n\n', '\n      Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling\n      happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil\n      here. Now --\n\n      PULL BACK to reveal --\n\n      A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy\n      holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.\n\n', '\n      And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter\n      is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.\n\n      Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.\n\n      Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he\n      moves on.\n\n\n', "\n      Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,\n      closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,\n      takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.\n      Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied\n      bed.\n\n      A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver\n      clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop\n      the other, several more photos of the happy couple --\n\n      -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a\n      thick leather handle.\n\n      Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large\n      full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.\n\n      Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,\n      he's studying the mirror itself.\n\n      He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs\n      and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.\n\n", '\n', '\n     Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up\n     the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at\n     the large mirror, clicks once --\n\n     -- and the mirror swings silently open.\n\n     A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:\n     There is an armchair in the middle facing where the\n     mirror had been.\n\n     Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote\n     held in his hand.\n\n     The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very\n     carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he\n     takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.\n\n     Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his\n     backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed\n     room --\n\n\n', "\n     It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,\n     piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables\n     we'll get around to.\n\n     Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.\n\n     He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it\n     that is identical to the one he replaced at the side\n     table.\n\n     Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.\n     First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large\n     denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of\n     slender boxes --\n\n     The first box as Luther opens it.\n\n     Jewelry.\n\n     Into the duffel it goes.\n\n     Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.    And\n     still more. As he continues to do this --\n\n\n", "\n     All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a\n     friendly green.\n\n     Now, from somewhere, a distant sound.

They disappear into the duffel.\n\n      Stamp books.   Gone into the swelling duffel.\n\n      Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.

The DOOR CLICKS --\n\n\n', '\n      -- Luther is alone in the darkness.\n\n      A burst of LAUGHTER now.    Growing nearer still.\n\n      Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,\n      doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,\n      Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...\n\n      Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.\n\n', '\n\n', '\n      Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside\n      the open bedroom door.\n\n      Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a\n      WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.\n\n      The Woman closes the bedroom door.\n\n      Darkness again.\n\n      And now the LAUGHING sound increases.    GIGGLING, really.\n', '\n', '\n     Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED\n     but it is there.

Luther is\n     staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.\n\n     Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he\n     was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.\n\n     Just a few feet away, just outside the door.\n\n     Where things are clearly starting to heat up.\n\n     Luther moves to the armchair, sits.    There is nothing to\n     do now but wait. He settles in.\n\n\n", "\n     They are staring at each other.\n\n     We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.\n     But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.\n\n     This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.\n     Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep\n     blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered\n     black dress. An expensive necklace.\n\n     One more thing:   she is staggering drunk.\n\n     The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome\n     and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.\n\n     Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the\n     husband in the wedding photo.
