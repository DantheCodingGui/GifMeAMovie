Ash speaks to\n\t   the CAMERA with urgency:\n', "\t\t\t   Why would you say that I am\n\t\t\t   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've\n\t\t\t   lost my mind simply because I've\n\t\t\t   heard the voices and seen the\n\t\t\t   godless things moving in the\n\t\t\t   woods. If anything, I think more\n\t\t\t   clearly now than ever before. I\n\t\t\t   know now that there is such a\n\t\t\t   thing as a living Evil. A dark\n\t\t\t   and shapeless thing that lives\n\t\t\t   not in the spaces we know, but\n\t\t\t   between them. In the Dark. In the\n\t\t\t   night. And it wants the exact same\n\t\t\t   thing as you and I: a chance at\n\t\t\t   warm life on this Earth. It\n\t\t\t   doesn't care that is already had\n\t\t\t   that chance ...once. Now listen\n\t\t\t   closely because there isn't much\n\t\t\t   time. Listen and believe, because\n\t\t\t   it's all true.\n", '\t   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny\n\t   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.\n', '\t\t\t   I first saw the damn thing at that\n\t\t\t   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.\n\t\t\t   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound\n\t\t\t   in human flesh and inked in human\n\t\t\t   blood. It contained bizarre burial\n\t\t\t   rites, prophesies...and\n\t\t\t   instruction for demon\n\t\t\t   resurrection. It was never meant\n\t\t\t   for the world of the living.\n\n', '\t   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.\n', '\t\t\t   The book awoke something dark in\n\t\t\t   the woods.\n', '\t   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with\n\t   white eyes.\n', '\t   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low\n\t   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the\n\t   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.\n', '\t\t\t   It got into my hand and it went\n\t\t\t   bad.\n', '\t   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.\n', '\t\t\t   So I lopped it off at the wrist.\n', '\t   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.\n', '\t   sweep past the moon.\n', '\t\t\t   In order to rid myself of the foul\n\t\t\t   thing, I read from a passage in\n\t\t\t   the book that was supposed to open\n\t\t\t   a hole.  A hole in Time that would\n\t\t\t   send the Evil back. And it worked.\n', '\t   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.\n', '\t   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88\n\t   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.\n', "\t\t\t   ...I just didn't plan on coming\n\t\t\t   along.\n", '\t   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the\n\t   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.\n', '\t   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is\n\t   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of\n\t   Time.\n', "\t   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build\n\t   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke\n\t   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the\n\t   words:\n", '\t\t\t\t\t   "Vs"\n\t   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...\n', '\t   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...\n', '\t   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily\n\t   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this\n\t   funnel cloud.

They halt before\n\t   Ash.\n', '\t   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:\n', '\t\t\t   Hail to him who has come from the\n\t\t\t   sky to deliver us from the terror\n\t\t\t   of the Deadites!  Hail!\n', '\t   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.\n', '\t   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...\n', '\t   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into\n\t   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants.

Ash cries out in pain\n\t   as...\n", '\t   is cut. A thin red gash.\n', '\t\t\t   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The\n\t\t\t   one written of in the Book would\n\t\t\t   not bleed.\n', '\t   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.\n', "\t\t\t   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.\n\t\t\t   I say to the pit with him!

But he is met with the wooden stock\n\t   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his\n\t   jaw.\n", '\t   He tumbles from the horse.\n', "\t   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.\n", "\t   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.\n", '\t   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face\n\t   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.\n', '\t   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but\n\t   manages to hang on for dear life.\n', '\t\t\t   Where the hell they put the\n\t\t\t   stirrups on this thing!!??\n', '\t   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.\n', '\t   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.\n', '\t\t\t   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.\n', '\t   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining\n\t   Warriors watch for sport.\n', '\t   They are gaining an Ash.\n', '\t   glances behind him.\n', '\t   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.\n', '\t   whips his horse.\n', '\t   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.\n', '\t   ducks the blade.\n', "\t   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the\n\t   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.\n", '\t   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.\n', '\t   ASH looks left...\n', '\t   winds up for another blow.\n', "\t   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.\n", "\t   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.\n", '\t   swings.\n', '\t   slams the First Horseman across the face.\n', '\t   is knocked from his steed.\n', '\t   is moving fast when he hits the ground.

He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into\n\t   place.  CLINK!\n\t   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter\n\t   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses\n\t   and yanks again.\n", '\t   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword\n\t   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!\n', "\t   is knocked from his steed.

A collar forces his neck upward.\n', '\t\t\t   To the castle!\n', '\t   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.\n\t   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners\n\t   to run alongside them.\n', '\t   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He\n\t   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the\n\t   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.\n', '\t   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.\n', '\t   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides\n\t   alongside him.\n', '\t\t\t   Move along now!\n', "\t   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find\n\t   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.\n\t   A drawbridge is lowered.

She spits and kicks\n\t   at him as he's dragged along.\n", '\t\t\t   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!\n\t\t\t   Thou art a Murderer!
