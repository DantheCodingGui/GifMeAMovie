The clientele is young, wealthy and \nconfident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: \npouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.\n\nCLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.\n\n', 'With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula \nCaesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish \nmeatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge \nbreast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...\n\nHuge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen \ntable cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four \ninches square and look exactly alike.\n\nCLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of \nconversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse \nme? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."\n\n', 'And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our \npasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...\n\nCLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate \nperpendicular desserts descending on another table.\n\nPATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID \nVAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing \nexpensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back \nhair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. \n\nThe camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:\n\n', "We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California \nplace on the Upper East Side.\n\nThe Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately \ndecorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's \ndescription of each of the men at the table.\n\n", "You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in \na remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences \nbetween us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van \nPatten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the \nbest looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a \nbad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten \nkeeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . \n\n", 'What are the rules for a sweater vest?\n\nMcDERMOTT \nWhat do you mean?\n\n', 'Yes. Clarify.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nWell, is it strictly informal-\n\n', 'Or can it be worn with a suit?\n\nMcDERMOTT \n(Smiling) \nExactly\n\n', "With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or \ncharcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder \nvest.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nBut avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or\ntie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look \ntoo studied.\n\n", 'You think so?\n\n', "You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.\n\n", 'Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.\n\nVan Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy \ndiscreetly removes their largely untouched plates.\n\n', 'Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?\n\n', "It looks that way, doesn't it?\n\nMcDERMOTT \n(Staring at retreating waiter) \nDid he just take our plates away?\n\n", "He took them away because the portions are so small he \nprobably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. \nThis is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?\n\nMcDERMOTT \nBecause Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.\n(He guffaws)\n\nBateman throws a swizzle stick at him.\n\nMcDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man\nwith slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nIs that Reed Robinson over there?\n", "Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nWho is it then?\n\n", "That's Paul Owen.\n\n", "That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the\nroom. Over there.\n\nHe points to another handsome young man with slicked-back \nhair and horn-rimmed glasses.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nWho is he with?\n\n", "(Distracted by the waitress's \ncleavage as she bends over to \nuncork a bottle of wine \x96 the \nwaitress glares at him) \nSome weasel from Kicker Peabody.\n\nVan Patten returns.\n\n", "They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nAre you sure that's Paul Owen over there?\n\n", "Yes. McDufus, I am.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nHe's handling the Fisher account.\n\n", 'Lucky bastard.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nLucky Jew bastard.\n\n', "Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with \nanything?\n\nMcDERMOTT \nListen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the\nphone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The \nbastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.\n\n", 'You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. \nYou spin a dreidel.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nOh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up\nsome fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?\n\n', "No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nOh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the \n", '\nPrice leans over and pats Bateman on the back.\n\n', 'The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking \nof reasonable...\n\nHe shows McDermott the bill for the meal.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nOnly $470.\n\n', '(Without irony) \nNot bad.\n\nThe others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap\ndown on the table.\n\n', 'Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is \nlighting up a cigar.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nLast week I picked up this Vassar chick-\n\n', "Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this \nstory again.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nBut I never told you what happened afterwards. So \nokay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big \ntits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I \nbuy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on \nspring break and she's practically blowing me in the \nChandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-\n\n", "Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all \nthis?\n\nMcDERMOTT \nOh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick \nwho's gonna let me-\n\n", "(Putting his hands over his ears) \nI don't want to hear this. He's going to say something \ndisgusting.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nYou prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op \ntogether or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some \nchick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.\n\nPrice throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nAnyway, so we're back at my place and listen to \nthis. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking \nrhino tipsy, and get this-\n\n", "She let you fuck her without a condom?\n\nMcDERMOTT \nThis is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She \nwould only-are you ready? \n(Dramatic pause) \nShe would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept \nher glove on.\n\nThe men sit in shocked, horrified silence.\n\nALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.\n\n", "\nThe limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. \nMcDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, \nwho looks confused.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nI suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask \nhim if he takes American Express.\n\n", '(Offering card) \nYou take Amex, dude?\n\nThe man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, \nunhooks the \nvelvet rope and welcomes them inside.\n\n', "\nBrilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a \nblack-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. \nMUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls \nstare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the \ncounter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as \nwomen in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they \nwait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple \nlurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes \npast them and slams the door.\n\n", "There's this theory out now that if you can catch the \nAIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, \nthen you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular \ndystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for \nChrist's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-\n\n", "I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a \nvirus.\n\n", "Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.\n\nPrice and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is \nsweating.\n\n", "I'm shaking. You open it.\n\nBateman opens a tiny packet of coke.\n\n", "Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?\n\n", "Maybe it's just the light.\n\n", 'Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips \nthe corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) \nOh my God...\n\n', 'What?\n\n', "It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!\n\nBateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.\n\n", "It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do \nenough of it we'll be okay.\n\n", 'I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it \non my fucking All-Bran.\n\nThe GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate \nvoice:\n\n', "Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!\n\nPrice pounds his fist against the stall.\n\n", '(screaming) \n', '\n', "Calm down. Let's do it anyway\n\n", "I guess you're right...\n(Raising his voice) \n", '\n', 'Fuck you!\n\n', "(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) \nNo, FUCK YOU!! \n(He collapses, panting against the stall door) \nSorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.\n\n", "That's the spirit.\n\nThey both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope \nof white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking \ntheir fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into \ntheir gums.\n\n", '\nBateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" \nplays in the background.\n\nBATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.\n\nHe hands her two drink tickets.\n\n', "It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's \na cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.\n\nBateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her \na $50.\n\nShe turns her back and searches the cash register for \nchange.\n\nBATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to \ndeath and then play around with your blood.\n\nThe music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is \nsmiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.\n\n", "\nTableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. \nA huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows \nlooking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist \nhigh style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large \nBaselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive \nelectronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly \nimpersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of \na design magazine.\n\n", 'My name is Patrick Bateman. I am \ntwenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden \nBuildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh \nfloor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.\n\nBateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to \nsee his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his \ntoilet.\n\n', "(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a \nbalanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the \nmorning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice \npack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand \nnow.\n\nBateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.\n\nBateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living \nroom wearing the ice pack.\n\n", '\nA mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the \nshower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.\n\n', 'After I remove the icepack, I use a deep \npore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a \nwater-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body \nscrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.\n\nBateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a \ngel facial masque.\n\n', 'Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which \nI leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my \nroutine.\n\nBateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is \nstocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He \nbegins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in \nreadiness on the marble counter.\n\n', 'I always use an after-shave lotion with little \nor no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes \nyou look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye \nbalm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...\n\nBateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, \ngiving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been \nwrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque \noff his face.\n\n', 'There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some \nkind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an \nentity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold \ngaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you \nand maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably \ncomparable: I simply am not there.\n\n', "\nAnother huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled \nwhite sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large \nexpensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by \nBateman's interior decorator.\n\nDressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a \nhuge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, \nshoes and designer suits, organized according to color and \ntone.\n\n", 'It is hard for me to make sense on any given \nlevel. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality \nis sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is \npersistent.\n\nFully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a \nfull-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, \nadjusting his cuff-links.\n\n', 'My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared \na long time ago, if they ever did exist.\n\nHe gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. \nHe gives his reflection a smile.\n\n', '\nAs Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who \nlooks just like him.\n\n', 'Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.\n\nBateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling \nhis Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive, \nwholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.\n\n', 'Late?\n\n', 'Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?\n\n', "Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what \nhe was canceling or why.\n\n", 'I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. \nAnyone else?\n\n', 'And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.\n\n', 'When?\n\n', 'After six.\n\n', 'Negative. Cancel it.\n\nJean follows him into his office.\n\n', 'Oh? And what should I say?\n\n', 'Just...say...no.\n\n', 'Just say no?\n\nJean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.\n\n', 'Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols \nat twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All \nright?\n\n', '(Playfully) \nYes, sir.\n\nShe turns to leave.\n\n', 'Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight \ntonight.\n\nJean turns around.\n\n', 'Oh, something. . romantic?\n\n', "No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.\n\n", "I'll do it.\n\n", 'No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?\n\n', 'You look nice today.\n\nJean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his \noffice, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a \nslightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a \nbeer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a \nSports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment \nlater with the Perrier and a file.\n\n', 'Yes?\n\n', "Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that \noutfit again.\n\n", "Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.\n\n", 'I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a \ndress. A skirt or something.\n\nJean stands there, then looks down at herself.\n\n', "(Smiling bravely) \nYou don't like this, I take it?\n\n", "Come on, you're prettier than that.\n\n", '(Sarcastically) \nThanks, Patrick.\n\nThe phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.\n\n', "I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.\n\nAs Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner \nof the room and starts watching Jeopardy!\n\n", "\nEVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's \nfiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping \na bottle of mineral water.

I don't want to leave anything \nout here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes \nof a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...\nwell, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. \nTonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not \nsure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess \nI'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show \nup at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.\n\nBateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight \ncircles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises \nup over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the \nsky.\n\n", '\nKIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.\n\n', '(Very surprised) \nNo hash browns? \n\n', 'Not in the mood, I guess.\n\n', "But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I \nmean- it's-have you been here before?\n\n", "(Deliberately nonchalant) \nYes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...\nordering them.\n\n", "(Looking at him like he's nuts) \nSuit yourself, I guess.\n\nPause.\n\n", 'So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on \nwhat you did?\n\n', "I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some \nsorbet?\n\n", "I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.\n\n", 'But how? Where do you place Paul that night?\n\n', 'According to his date book, and this was verified by his \nsecretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.\n\n', 'And?\n\n', "I've questioned him.\n\n", 'Marcus?\n\n', "Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't \nbe sure.\n\n", 'But Marcus denied it?\n\n', 'Yes.\n\n', 'Well, does Marcus have an alibi?\n\n', 'Yes.\n\nA pause.\n\n', "He does? You're sure?\n\n", "(smiling)\nI checked it out. It's clean.\n\n", 'Oh.\nKIMBALL Now where were you? \n(He laughs) \n\n', '(Laughing with him) \nWhere was Marcus? \n\n', "He wasn't with Paul \nOwen. \n\n", 'So who was he with? \n\n', 'He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, \nHarry Newman, George Butner and \x96 \n(He pauses, Then looks up) \n- you.\n\nA moment of stunned silence.\n\n', 'Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen \nto come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner \nwith Victoria...the following night. \n\n', "Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for \na while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. \nWhatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or \nlater. \n(A pause) \nI mean, to think that one of his friends \nkilled him, for no reason whatsoever would be too \nridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? \n\nMcDermott stops by the table. \n\nMcDERMOTT \nKIMBALL! How's the investigation? \nTalking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. \n(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) \nBateman, what's wrong with ,you? \n\nBateman looks at him in silence, \npanicking. \n\nMcDERMOTT \nYou can't eat at Smith and Wollensky \nwithout ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a \nraving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. \n(He wanders off muttering) \nNo fucking hash browns...\n\n", "\nBateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He \nhas a surgical mask in one hand.\n\n", 'What can I do for you, sir?\n\n', '\n', 'Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.\n\n', 'Mrs. Wolfe?\n\n', "The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,\ndon't you?\n\nBateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down\nthe hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly \npainted and has been immaculately redecorated in English \ncountry-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There \nare flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands \nadmiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman \nwanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops \nat the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He \nopens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. \nWolfe approaches, smiling.\n\n", "Are you my two o'clock?\n\n", 'No.\n\nMrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the \nsurgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.\n\n', 'Can I help you?\n\n', "I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.\n\nShe stares at him impassively.\n\n", "Doesn't he live here?\n\n", "No, he doesn't.\n\n", 'Are you sure?\n\n', 'You saw the ad in the Times?\n\n', "No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...\ndoesn't Paul Owen still live here?\n\n", 'There was no ad in the Times.\n\nBateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.\n\n', 'I think you should go now.\n\n', 'But I think...I want to know what happened \nhere.\n\n', "Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.\n\nBateman backs away slowly.\n\n", "Don't come back.\n\n", "I won't...don't worry.\n\nMrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, \nrattled, and gets into the elevator.\n\n", '\nBateman enters the revolving \ndoor of an office building, panicking and breathing \nheavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks \nderanged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes \nout onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY \njust like him.\n\n', 'Hey, Kinsley.\n\nBateman looks up at him wild-eyed.\n\n', 'See you at Fluties, okay?\n\nThe guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down \nthe street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage \ncans, etc.\n\n', "\nBateman searches his pockets \nfor pills. He finds three different pills and swallows \nthem. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his \nface, dialing a number.\n\n", "Patrick Bateman's office.\n\n", 'Jean? Hello? Jean?\n\n', 'Patrick? Is that you?\n\n', 'Hello? Jean, I need help!\n\n', 'Where are you?\n\n', "Jean-I'm not-\n\n", "Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and \nDavid Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.\n\n", 'Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?\n\n', "Patrick? I can't hear you.\n\n", 'What are I doing?\n\n', "Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?\n\n", "I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.\n\nPause.\n\n", '...to the office this afternoon.\n\n', 'Why?\n\n', '(Screaming) \nJust...say...no!\n\n', 'What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?\n\n', 'Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!\n\nHe hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck \ninto a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his \njacket.\n\n', "\nJean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens \nhis desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.\n\n", "\nBateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the \nprevious scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking \nand disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, \nstill breathing heavily.\n\nPrice is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nBateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough \nday at the office?\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nHey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking \nPerrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't \nget a reservation to save his life.\n\nBateman sits down silently.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nWhy don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.\n\n", "(On automatic) \nI'm not going anywhere unless we \nhave a reservation.\n\nVAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, \nfaggots-just get a res.\n\n", 'Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.\n\nBateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. \n\n', '(He downs his drink) \nExcuse me, gentlemen. Right back.\nHe approaches Carnes cautiously. \n\n', "Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the \nend of the '90s.\n\nBateman approaches, trying to act casual.\n\n", 'Shut up, Carnes, they will not.\n\nCarnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.\n\n', 'So, Harold, did you get my message?\n\nCarnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.\n\n', "Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, \nwasn't it?\n\n", '(Waving smoke out of his face) \nYes, naturally.\n\n', "Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s \nfabulous. That's rich...\n\nPause\n\n", "It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?\n\n", 'What exactly do you mean?\n\n', 'The message you left.\n\nCarnes is distracted, waving at people.\n\n', "By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still \nseeing her, right?\n\n", "But wait, Harold, what do you mean?\n\nCarnes isn't really listening.\n\n", 'Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?\n\nHe turns to go.\n\n', 'Carnes? Wait.\n\n', "(Sighing) \nDavis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. \nBut come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, \nsuch a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully \nappreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said \nPrice, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's \nhave lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.\n\n", 'What are you talking about? Bateman is what?\n\n', 'Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let \nalone...what was it you said he did to her?\n\nCarnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing \ncouple. He laughs politely.\n\n', "Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...\n\n", "(Desperate, shouting) \nWait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really \ncomprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. \nI'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. \nI tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your \nmachine was true.\n\n", 'Excuse me. I really must he going.\n\n', "No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm \nPatrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! \nDon't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.\n\nCarnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.\n\n", "Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed \nPaul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer\n\n", "But that's simply not possible. And I don't find \nthis funny anymore.\n\n", "It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?\n\n", "(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)\nIt's just not.\n\n", 'Why not, you stupid bastard?\n\nCarnes stares at him.\n\n', 'Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in \nLondon...just ten days ago.\n\n', "No, you...didn't?\n\n", "Now, if you'll excuse me.\n\nBateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.\nThey are all looking at the television, where Ronald \nReagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are \nhalfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's \nlying.\n\n", 'How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?\n\n', "What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? \nI mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have \nreservations somewhere.\n\n", "(To Bateman) \nI don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...\nout of it. So...undangerous.\n\nMcDERMOTT \nHe is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.\nJust like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that \nshit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, \nwhat can I say?\n\n", "I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that \nway and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so \nfucking, I don't know, cool about it?\n\n", 'Some guys are just born cool, I guess.\n\nBateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.\n\n', 'And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?\n\n', "I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.\n", "(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. \nWorking for UNICEF now?\n\nMcDERMOTT \nDo you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?\n\n", 'Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless \nOld codger. But inside...\n\nPause.\n\n', "But inside...\n\nThe SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:\n\n", "But inside doesn't matter...\n\n", "\nMcDERMOTT \n(Bored)\nInside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually \nlistening to you.\n\n", 'Bateman? Come on, what do you think? \n\nBateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.\n\n', 'Whatever.\n\nThe conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone. \n\n', 'Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.\n\nThe sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs \nover images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking \non portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of \nother very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking \non portable phones, talking, laughing,\n\n', 'There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with \nthe uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, \nall the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward \nit, I have now surpassed...\n\n', "\nJean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary. \nWe see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with \ndoodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost \nand frightened, and begins to cry.\n\n", 'My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better \nworld for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on \nothers. I want no escape.\n\n', 'As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is \nleaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, \nhis eyes blank.\n\n', 'But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no \ndeeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted \nfrom my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any \nof this.
