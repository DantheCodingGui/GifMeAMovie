Young Edward ducks between trees,\n               under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for\n               breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as\n               fast as he can.\n", '               Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its\n               P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him.\n', '               As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through\n               the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something\n               bright. Edward runs towards it.\n', '               Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running\n               towards the bright light.\n', "               The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge\n               of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only\n               Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.\n", '               The beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the\n               dark forest.\n               A dozen uniformed DEPUTIES move through the forest, shining\n               their flashlights around, searching.\n', '                The trees tower over them. A low fog hangs in the air. The\n               flashlight beams can barely penetrate it.\n', '               A large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. A\n               small, dense forest stretches out behind it.\n', '               The sign on the front reads: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL LIGHT\n', "               Several patrol cars are parked along the Orphanage's gravel\n               driveway.

But their beds were\n                         empty. Every one of them.

A\n               thick mist hangs in the trees.\n', '               As Deputy Adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright\n               light streaming through the trees up ahead.\n', '               Deputy Adams comes through the trees and emerges into a\n               clearing in the woods.\n', "               He sees a Shed in the clearing up ahead.

On the door is a\n               sign marked: DANGER, along with the symbol for ELECTRICITY.\n', '               Deputy Adams enters the Shed.\n', '              The Shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power\n              cables, and various implements for repairing power lines.\n', '              Deputy Adams sweeps through the Shed with his flashlight.\n', '              He approaches a large transformer module that sits at the\n              back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity.\n', "              There's a LOW SHUFFLING sound. Deputy Adams stops.\n", '              He carefully peers around behind the transformer. The space\n              is too small for a full-size person.\n', '              But sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young\n              Edward. He clutches himself, shivering, frightened.\n', '              The Sheriff stands with his Deputies. His walkie-talkie\n              CRACKLES to life.\n', "                          Sheriff! I found one! White, male, about\n                          ten years old. Looks to be unharmed. He's\n                          in a utility shed maybe half a mile from\n                          the orphanage.\n", "              Deputy Adams approaches Young Edward. He takes off his jacket\n              and wraps it around Young Edward's shoulders.\n", '              Young Edward pulls the jacket around him and smiles, still\n              scared, but happy to see the Deputy.\n', '                          Are you okay, son? Are the other kids\n                          around here?\n', "                          I don't know... I don't remember...\n", "                          Why don't we start with your name?
