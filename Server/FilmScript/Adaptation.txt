Wild hogs.\n\nKaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water.\nNowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers\nrun along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops.\n\n", '          Wait.   Do you hear something?\n\nKaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing.\n\n', "          Donald, that sounds bad.\n\nThe brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping\ngets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the\nshore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark\nfor bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and\nOrlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the\nengine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the\npigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman\nkicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick\nconnects and the pig flies into the water.\n\n", '\nLaroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. It\nnicks the boat. Donald looks back and the boat heads for a\ncypress stand.\n\n', '          Watch out, watch out, watch out!\n\nDonald gets the boat back on course. Laroche and Orlean have\nbeen left far behind.

Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet\nhits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame,\nilluminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown,\nalong with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water,\nlooks all around for Kaufman.\n\n                      DONALD (cont'd)\n          Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you?\n\nUnderwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The\nmurky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the\nsurface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces.\n\nOn the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water,\nthen get jerked back down. Donald dives.\n\nUnderwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the\nleg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken\npropeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs\nKaufman, and brings him to the surface.\n\nDonald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is\nfired. It skims the water near Kaufman.\n\n", "          Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead.\n\n", "          We're okay. How's your leg?\n\n", "          I don't know.

My back is fine.\n\nLaroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting.\n\nMike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck\nand agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames.\n\nDonald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping\nKaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls.\n\n", "          Donald!\n\nKaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and\nmangled.

Okay?\n\n", '          Okay.\n\nDonald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears\nout of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his\nbrother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van\nfollows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt.\n\n', '\nSmoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out\nof the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They\nfollow Kaufman into the swamp.\n\nMike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out,\nsurveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground.\n\n', "          Jesus, that writer guy.\n\nOwen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken.\nHe lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off.\n\nKaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean\nfollow the sound of his sloshing.\n\n", '          Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon\n          plastic jewels plopping onto a silver\n          trampoline!

Up ahead, Kaufman limps out\nof the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused.\nHe checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and\nskids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps\nover to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.\n\n", '          You gotta help me.

What are you --\n\nBefore Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's\nbody flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen\ndown, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in\nalgae-matted fur.\n\n                       MIKE OWEN (cont'd)\n          Holy shit.\n\n\n", "\n\nThe two men turn and run.\n\n                       MIKE OWEN (cont'd)\n          It's real!

Can we trade?\n\n', "          Stand back, sweetness.\n\nLaroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away.
