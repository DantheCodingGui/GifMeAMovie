Behind the stage a light\n     from an open door...\n', "                This is unwatchable. It's not even in\n                focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is\n                in the shot. This is really shoddy work.\n", "     The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a\n     TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.\n", "                Why do they always show the guy's face?\n                It's like, can't we just assume he's\n                enjoying it?\n     We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.\n", "                Because they're trying to make us feel\n                like we're better looking than that guy,\n                so we should be able to get chicks as hot\n                as her.\n", '                How the hell do you know?\n', "                It's a basic rule of porno.\n     Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.\n     They're watching the porno...\n", '     ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can\n     still hear the porno.

He pulls a large wad of toilet\n    paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred\n    pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.\n", '    Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a\n    stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.\n', "              We're going to be late.

She walks by Matt without noticing, and\n      the door to the locker room closes slowly.\n      Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,\n      a sliver of daylight still visible.\n      Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the\n      boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too\n      immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.\n      He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He\n      turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.\n", '      The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras.\n      Panties. Towels...\n', "      Matt's eyes widen.

The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away.\n     Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees\n     a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.\n', '               People always talk about how tough it is\n               being a teenage girl.

He sees some\n     CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some\n     books for class.\n', "               I'll tell you what's really hard.
