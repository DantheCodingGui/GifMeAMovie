It is\n                        therefore the judgement of this court\n                        that she be returned to the convent of\n                        Marie Madeleine where she will be cared\n                        for under proper medical supervision by\n                        a visiting physician.\n\n        Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this.

And one night\n                        I heard the most beautiful voice\n                        imaginable. And when I looked I saw\n                        the moon shining down on him.
