Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.\nThe fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.\nA good face, nonetheless.\nHe stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.\nNext to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of\nhim, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.\n\n', '\t\tTend you quickly he will,\n\t\twith bottles from a shelf.\n\t\tBut heals not, so easily,\n\t\tThe ills which plague himself.\n\nBrother John stops stirring.\n\n', "\t\t   (to Kyle)\n\t\tEnough.\n\nHe scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the\nBurned Monk's arm.

I passed\n\t\thim on the way up.  He said you'd come \n\t\tin alone.  I knew better.\n\nHe scratches the back of Mattias' neck.\n\n", '\t\tHello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?\n\nThe dog snuffles in response.\n\n', "\t\tYou know what Philip says about Mattias'\n\t\thair and his breathing.  You'll have to \n\t\ttake him out of here.\n\n", "\t\tHe likes when I read to him and -- I \n\t\tcan't --\n\nJohn looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels\nalmost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  \nThe Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.\n\n", '\t\t    (smiles)\n\t\tSomeone must have left this one unlocked.\n\t\tTake the book with you.\n\nHe hands the key to John, who is shocked --\nthis is a great honor.\n\n', '\t\tFather, I --?\n\n', '\t\tKyle tells me you did a good job at\n\t\tthe glassworks today.\n\n', "\t\tI'll reserve judgement until the patient\n\t\tlives.\n\nJohn crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.\nHe returns the key.\n\n", "\t\tIt will get easier.

Spread across the inky void.\nBathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.\n\nJohn smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. \nThe atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. \nHe opens the book.\nReads aloud --\n\n", '\t\tIn the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother\n\t\tGerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury\n\t\tthe Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day\n\t\tby day, one by one, until I am the only \n\t\tone left.
