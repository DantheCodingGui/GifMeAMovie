Rhythmically.\r\n          A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing\r\n          whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the\r\n          ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.\r\n", "          Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then...\r\n          ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing\r\n          pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s).\r\n          We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their\r\n          movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at\r\n          her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops.\r\n          Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.\r\n", "                      What's wrong?\r\n", '                      Nothing.\r\n          Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.\r\n', "                      You used to enjoy it. Now it's...\r\n          He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette.\r\n", "                      ...it's like fucking a corpse.\r\n          Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna.\r\n", "                      Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was--\r\n          Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul\r\n          puts his head in his hands.\r\n", '          Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred\r\n          ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.\r\n', "                      Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid\r\n                      thing to say.   But you know sometimes...\r\n                      sometimes it's like you're not here\r\n                      anymore.

We sense the emptiness inside her.\r\n", '                    Are you happy?\r\n          She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply.\r\n', "                    I'm happy.\r\n", '          falls into the water.   Then another drop.\r\n', '          her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks\r\n          impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF\r\n          WATER carries into the next scene...\r\n', "          A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant.\r\n          Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them\r\n          meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel.\r\n          Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.\r\n", '          A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.\r\n          Pastoral and idyllic.

On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD\r\n          DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a\r\n          red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the\r\n          vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.\r\n          The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind\r\n          her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...\r\n          ... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on\r\n          her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The\r\n          DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.\r\n", '          Anna locks her car.   Heads towards the main building.\r\n', '          Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy,\r\n          walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER\r\n          BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY\r\n          against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.\r\n', '                    Hey.   Jack-off!\r\n          Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him.\r\n          He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.\r\n', "          Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's\r\n          lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him\r\n          jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic\r\n          incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.\r\n", "                    Didn't you hear me Jack-off?\r\n          Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as\r\n          the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply.\r\n", '                    He must be deaf.\r\n', '                    You deaf Jack-off?\r\n          Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more.\r\n', "                    Can't fucking speak either.\r\n          He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator.\r\n          Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just\r\n          then the door opens. Anna walks in.\r\n", "                    What's going on?\r\n          She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.\r\n", '                    Jack?\r\n', '                    Nothing Miss Bryant.\r\n', "                    Nothing? The incubator didn't just\r\n                    fall by itself.\r\n          The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction.\r\n", "                    I tripped.   It was an accident.\r\n          Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying.\r\n", "                           (to the Older Boys)\r\n                    Show's over. Get to your classes.\r\n", "                    Jack. Help me clear up.\r\n          Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY\r\n          CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.\r\n", "                    I think it's dead.\r\n          Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick.\r\n", "                    No.   The poor thing's just scared.\r\n", "          School's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of\r\n          exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF\r\n          PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry.\r\n", "          Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large\r\n          conference table covered with documents and thick files.\r\n          He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty.\r\n", '                    OK.   Who took the last pepperoni?\r\n          A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.\r\n', '                    Great.

Suddenly realizes the time.\r\n          He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door.\r\n", '                    You ordering in another pizza?\r\n', '                    Yeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.\r\n          Everyone laughs.\r\n', '                    Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses.\r\n', '          Paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone.\r\n', "          Anna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She\r\n          fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door.\r\n          Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call.\r\n", "          Paul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard.\r\n", "                    Hi baby.    I'm really sorry about this\r\n                    morning.    I fucked up. I know.\r\n", '          Anna steps into an empty corridor.\r\n', '                    We still on for tonight?\r\n', '                    Anna?\r\n', "                    I don't know Paul.\r\n", "          Paul's anxious.    We sense he's hiding something.\r\n", '                    Please Anna.

What's the matter?\r\n          Paul tries hard to cover his nervousness.   Forces a smile.\r\n", "                    Nothing. Don't worry. I just need... I\r\n                    just want us to have dinner tonight.\r\n", "          Despite Paul's reassurances Anna is clearly worried now.\r\n", '                    Great.\r\n', '          Paul hesitates.    Lowers his voice.\r\n', "                    And Anna.    Everything's going to be fine.\r\n", '                    Promise?\r\n', '                    I promise.\r\n', "          Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks\r\n          through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo\r\n          loudly in the eerie quietness.\r\n          Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her\r\n          blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns.\r\n          WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step.\r\n          The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly\r\n          creeping up behind her. There's only one light still on\r\n          as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light\r\n          flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her in a\r\n          cold pool of light.\r\n          Anna's unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the\r\n          door. It doesn't open. She pushes hard with both hands.\r\n          Nothing. It's locked. She turns back slowly. The\r\n          darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She\r\n          reaches out...\r\n          ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness.     Anna\r\n          snatches her hand back. Stares at it.\r\n          Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS.    Moving\r\n          deliberately towards her.\r\n", '                    Hello?\r\n          Her voice echoes down the silent corridor.   She glimpses\r\n          something move in the blackness.\r\n', '                    Is someone there?\r\n', "          A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent.\r\n          Brooding. Anna can't move. Terrified. Suddenly the\r\n          corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.\r\n          Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand.     As she\r\n          tentatively pulls her hand away...\r\n          ...it's only Jack.   His hand on the light switch.\r\n", '                    Jack!\r\n', '                    Did I scare you Miss Bryant?\r\n          Jack moves over to the door.\r\n', "                    It's locked.\r\n          He gently pushes against the door.    The door slowly opens.\r\n", '          Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.\r\n', "                    Shouldn't you be home?\r\n", "                    My mom's picking me up.\r\n", "                    It's my birthday.

Stand in silence for a moment.\r\n", '                     Jack. Those boys.    Do they bother you\r\n                     a lot?\r\n          Jack hesitates.    Then slowly nods his head.\r\n', "                     You know you can always talk to me about\r\n                     it if you want to.\r\n          He nods.   Anna's clearly worried about him.\r\n", "                     You sure you don't need a ride?\r\n          Jack shakes his head.    Anna glances at her watch.\r\n", '                     Well.

Squeezes\r\n          the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills\r\n          from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove\r\n          compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs.\r\n", '          Jack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then\r\n          unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange\r\n          jerky movement.

Reaches for the door\r\n          handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when\r\n          the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a\r\n          freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.\r\n", "          Anna leans back against a washbasin.    Her neck tightly\r\n          cradled against the white porcelain.    The light's harsh\r\n          and not particularly flattering. She    closes her eyes.\r\n          Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER   in latex gloves\r\n          begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair.\r\n", '          Startling white.

Soft\r\n          morning light seeps in from a small round window set high\r\n          on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel.\r\n          In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab\r\n          covered with a white sheet.\r\n          We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The\r\n          room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.\r\n          Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket.\r\n          Carefully places it on a coat-hanger.

Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress\r\n          soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe.\r\n          Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist.\r\n          Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe.\r\n          Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel\r\n          trolley. Delicately slices open her dress.

He's surprised for a\r\n          moment then remembers the argument the night before.\r\n          He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a\r\n          cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. Leans\r\n          down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the\r\n          RING BOX falls onto the floor.

Searching for Anna's classroom.\r\n", '          A TEACHER stands in front of the class holding a shell.\r\n', "                    ... the shell grows slowly...\r\n          The door opens.

Her eyes glazed.\r\n          Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns.\r\n          Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty.\r\n          Nervously looks around.\r\n          For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she\r\n          sees Eliot by a CD player.

I'm only here to help you.\r\n          Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies\r\n          her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how\r\n          to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments.\r\n          Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna.\r\n          The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her\r\n          skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews\r\n          the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job.\r\n          Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an\r\n          AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid.\r\n          Anna's alarmed.

Then uncovers Anna's face.\r\n          The needle's still embedded in her eyebrow.\r\n", '                    Ah.   Forgive me.\r\n          Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle.

She\r\n          slowly pulls the sheet away...\r\n          The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna\r\n          with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken,\r\n          Anna pushes herself against the wall.\r\n", "                    Oh God.   Please.

Anger flashes across Eliot's\r\n          face, but just as quickly he controls it.\r\n", "                    You people. You all think that if you\r\n                    breathe, shit, piss you're alive.\r\n          Anna doesn't know what to say.\r\n", "                    You clutch onto life as if your life was\r\n                    worth clutching onto. Was your life\r\n                    worth clutching onto Anna?\r\n          Anna turns her head away.   Clearly he's struck a chord.\r\n", '                    Was it?   Maybe you died a long time ago.\r\n          Eliot rips off his latex gloves.    Tosses them into a bin.\r\n', "                    I have to tell you I'm surprised you're\r\n                    still arguing with me. You don't have\r\n                    much time left.\r\n                           (gestures to the Old Women)\r\n                    Look. She's accepted her death. Her\r\n                    life has been examined. She has no more\r\n                    regrets. And now she's at peace. She\r\n                    used her time well. You still have so\r\n                    much to learn.\r\n", '                    I have nothing to learn!\r\n', '                    Are you sure?\r\n          Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light.\r\n          His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.\r\n', "                    Your funeral's in three days. Soon\r\n                    you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then\r\n                    buried in the ground. No-one will hear\r\n                    you then. No-one will talk to you there.\r\n          The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move.\r\n          Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she\r\n          looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly\r\n          pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman\r\n          curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.\r\n", '                    Are you cold?\r\n', "          She takes the Old Woman's hand.      Strokes her paper-thin skin.\r\n", "                      I'm so cold.\r\n          Anna notices the Old Woman's plastic ankle tag.\r\n", '          Name: Carol Whitehall.     Sex: F.

Studies the Old Woman's serene face.\r\n", '                      You look so peaceful.\r\n', "                      Aren't you scared?\r\n          Anna's eyes fill with tears.\r\n", "                      I'm scared.    I'm so scared.\r\n", "          Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside\r\n          table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an\r\n          Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open\r\n          shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light.\r\n          The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even\r\n          though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the\r\n          box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches\r\n          it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.\r\n", "          Paul stands motionless in the middle of the room. Staring\r\n          blankly into space. The room feels empty and depressing.\r\n          He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into\r\n          the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player.\r\n          Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He\r\n          turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's\r\n          unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb.\r\n", "          The music's strangely distorted now.        Almost silent.   As\r\n          if we were inside Paul's head.\r\n", "          Anna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. O.S.\r\n          we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty\r\n          faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares\r\n          at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.\r\n          The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing\r\n          her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.\r\n          Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely\r\n          larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain\r\n          objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She\r\n          notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.\r\n          The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised.\r\n          The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna\r\n          with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to\r\n          the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow\r\n          to normal size.\r\n          Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel\r\n          trolley now towers high above her. The massive\r\n          instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects\r\n          cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a\r\n          solid wall of DARKNESS.\r\n", '          the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark\r\n          space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep\r\n          Room behind her.\r\n', "          Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick\r\n          blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then...\r\n          ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's\r\n          wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna\r\n          struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper\r\n          into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.\r\n", '          Anna stands in the black empty space.\r\n', "                      I'm disappointed with you.\r\n          An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of\r\n          the blackness. She looks like a young Anna.\r\n", '                      Who are you?\r\n', '          The Young Girl walks slowly towards Anna.\r\n', '                      You promised me so many things.\r\n', "                      You don't recognize me?\r\n          Anna shakes her head.\r\n", "                      I am you. I've been waiting for you.\r\n                      You shouldn't have disappointed me.\r\n          The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back\r\n          terrified. Turns. But there's no door anymore.\r\n", '          The Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room.\r\n          Braiding her long hair.\r\n', "                      You're not ready.\r\n", '          A small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs.\r\n          "AVE MARIA" plays quietly in the b.g.

Anna opens her eyes.\r\n          She\'s confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the\r\n          room. The other slab\'s empty. The Old Woman\'s gone.\r\n          Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside.\r\n          Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the\r\n          wall. There\'s nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a\r\n          counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm\r\n          across the counter top in rage. Sending everything\r\n          crashing to the floor.\r\n', "          The funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of\r\n          flowers from a vase.\r\n", '          In the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway.\r\n          Glancing around in fascination.

Smiles.\r\n', '                    Then perhaps you can help me.\r\n                           (holds up the withered flowers)\r\n                    Could you throw these away for me?\r\n          Jack nods hesitantly.   Moves over and takes the flowers.\r\n', '                    Thank-you.\r\n          Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.\r\n', '          as he looks at the wilted flowers.    He crushes a petal\r\n          then sniffs his fingers.\r\n', "                    There's no life left in them.\r\n", "          Jack looks up.   Eliot's watching him carefully.\r\n", '                    They belong in the garbage.\r\n          Jack turns to leave.\r\n', "                    I've seen you round here before.\r\n          Jack's suddenly nervous.\r\n", '                    Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?\r\n', "                    I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral.\r\n", "                    Ah. Miss Bryant. No.       Her funeral's not\r\n                    until Friday.\r\n", '                    Where is she now?\r\n          Eliot considers the question for a moment.\r\n', "                    She's downstairs.\r\n", '                    Why?\r\n', "                    Why?

What did you think?\r\n', '                    About what?\r\n', "                    Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.

I see.\r\n', '                    Are all funerals the same?\r\n', "                    No Jack. They're never the same. Each\r\n                    one is special. The dead always speak to\r\n                    us in different ways.\r\n", '                    What do you mean?\r\n          Eliot finished arranging the flowers.     He glances at his\r\n          watch. Smiles at Jack.\r\n', '                    It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.\r\n', "          Jack's intrigued.   He watches Eliot walk out of the room.\r\n", "          As Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH\r\n          from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to\r\n          the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind\r\n          him. He turns. Jack's at the top of the stairs.\r\n          Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door.\r\n          Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound\r\n          as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then\r\n          without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.\r\n", '          Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room.\r\n          Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro.\r\n          Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments.\r\n          Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.\r\n', '                    Why did you do this?\r\n          Anna ignores him.   Eliot strides over to her.\r\n', '          Anna stares at him blankly.\r\n', "                    Is this the afterlife?    Am I in heaven?\r\n                    Or am I in hell?\r\n          Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He nods his head.   His\r\n          anger gone now.\r\n", '                    The door...\r\n', '                    There was a door.

I promise.\r\n          For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's\r\n          conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together.\r\n          Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes.\r\n          Hugs her legs closer to her chest.\r\n", '                    Paul.\r\n          She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH.

Silence.\r\n          Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.\r\n          Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a\r\n          cloud of vapor.

Not me.\r\n          Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop.\r\n          Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off\r\n          his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a\r\n          collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and\r\n          snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.\r\n', "                      I'm not ready to die.\r\n          Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.\r\n", '                      Why are you still struggling?\r\n', "                      I'm not ready to die.   Not yet.\r\n          She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look.\r\n", "                      There's nothing out there for you\r\n                      anymore.\r\n          As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's\r\n          jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the\r\n          pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still\r\n          busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.\r\n", '          as he gets up and turns to Anna.\r\n', "          Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to\r\n          get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels\r\n          the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room.\r\n          Nudges the door stop away with his foot.\r\n", "                      I'll be back soon.\r\n          The door locks behind him with a CLICK.\r\n", '          Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted\r\n          windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of\r\n          Anna just before the accident).\r\n', "          Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on\r\n          the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van\r\n          drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys.\r\n", "          As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He's\r\n          low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and\r\n          makes a left turn.\r\n", "          Anna staggers to the door. There's at least a dozen keys.\r\n          She frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock.\r\n", "                           (begging the door to open)\r\n                    Please.\r\n          It doesn't fit. She's panicking. She fumbles for\r\n          another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key\r\n          SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.\r\n", '                    No!\r\n          Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments\r\n          on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of\r\n          surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.\r\n', '          Eliot replaces the pump nozzle.   Walks over to the cashier.\r\n', "                    Thirty-four fifty.\r\n          In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out\r\n          of the gas station. Eliot doesn't notice him as he pulls\r\n          out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he\r\n          frowns. Something's wrong. He checks his pockets again.\r\n          He can't find his keys. He walks quickly away.\r\n", '                    Sir.   Your change.\r\n          Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued,\r\n          Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.\r\n', "          Anna's still trying to pry out the broken key.\r\n", '                    Come on. Come on.\r\n', "          Eliot's at a red light. Drumming his fingers in\r\n          frustration as he waits for the light to change.\r\n", "          Finally Anna pulls out the broken key. Quickly chooses\r\n          another. Turns it gently. Again it doesn't fit. Anna's\r\n          hysterical now. She tries the next key. It fits! She's\r\n          stunned for a second. Then pulls open the door.\r\n", '          Eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery.\r\n', "          Anna staggers to the front door. She pulls at the door.\r\n          It won't open. Frantically she finds the key. Unlocks the\r\n          door, leaving the keys in the lock. As she opens the door,\r\n          HEADLIGHTS sweep across the hallway.\r\n", "          Eliot's van pulls up in front of the house.\r\n", "          Anna's trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot's footsteps\r\n          on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.\r\n", "          Eliot reaches the front door. It's slightly ajar.   He\r\n          pushes it open. Steps warily inside.\r\n", "          Eliot looks around. The entrance hall's empty.   Then he\r\n          notices the keys in the lock.\r\n", "          It's dark. Anna pulls at the back door. It won't budge.\r\n          She panics. Sees a kitchen knife on the counter.\r\n          Quickly grabs it. As she steps back, she knocks over a\r\n          metal bucket. The sound's DEAFENING in the silent house.\r\n", '          Eliot hears the NOISE. Smiles. He calmly locks the door\r\n          and puts the keys into his pocket. Moves down the\r\n          hallway towards the kitchen.\r\n', "          Eliot switches on the light.   The kitchen's empty.    He\r\n          steps back into the hallway.\r\n", '          He stands very still.    Watching.   Waiting.   We pull back.\r\n', '          Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife.\r\n', '          Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment\r\n          changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction\r\n          towards the viewing room.\r\n', '          Eliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks\r\n          around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet\r\n          STAMPING along the hallway behind him.\r\n', "          Anna runs to the front door. It's locked. She glances\r\n          around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs.\r\n          She weakly stumbles up the stairs.\r\n", '          Anna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room.\r\n          Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the\r\n          telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her.\r\n', '          Eliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs.    He cocks his\r\n          head upwards. Straining to listen.\r\n', '          Anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone.\r\n', '          A telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen.\r\n', '          Anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the\r\n          RINGING on the other end.\r\n', '                    Please pick up. Please pick up.\r\n', '          Eliot slowly climbs the stairs.\r\n', '          The phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares\r\n          at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks\r\n          worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes.\r\n', '          Anna glances back to the door in panic.\r\n', '                    Paul.   Please pick up.\r\n', '          Finally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone.\r\n', '          Anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece.\r\n', "                    Paul. I'm here.\r\n", "                    Help me Paul.\r\n          Anna's HOARSE DISTORTED VOICE sounds almost malevolent.\r\n          Paul's stunned. He stares at the phone as if it was\r\n          possessed. Then slowly puts it down.\r\n", '                    Leave me alone.\r\n', "          Anna looks at the phone in disbelief. The MONOTONOUS\r\n          TONE DRONES in the ear piece. She doesn't notice Eliot\r\n          appear in the doorway.\r\n", '                      Paul.\r\n          Suddenly the light comes on.\r\n', "                      I'm the only one who can hear you now.\r\n          Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window.      Eliot\r\n          walks over and calmly replaces the phone.\r\n", "                      I'd be very careful if I were you.

You're\r\n                      only causing him more pain. If you\r\n                      really loved him, you'd accept your death\r\n                      and let him go.\r\n", "                      Then prove to me I'm really dead.\r\n", '                      You people.   You always need proof.\r\n          Eliot places his hands on her shoulders.    Turns her\r\n          towards a tall mirror.\r\n', '          A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes.      A blood-stained\r\n          tear in the side of her RED SLIP.\r\n', "          Anna's stunned. She moves closer to the mirror.      Touches\r\n          her reflection through a thin layer of dust.\r\n", '                      Why do I look like a corpse?\r\n', '                      Because you are a corpse.\r\n', '          Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.\r\n', "                       It's time you finally accepted the truth.\r\n                       You are dead.

We see a\r\n          brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.\r\n", '          Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle.    Looking\r\n          up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.\r\n', '          Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening\r\n          in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.\r\n', "          Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at\r\n          the window. Calmly. Curiously.\r\n", "          Eliot coolly turns back to Anna. She hasn't noticed\r\n          Jack. Still staring at her reflection in the mirror.\r\n", '          Paul stares at the telephone. After a moment he slowly\r\n          pulls the telephone plug out of the wall. Mechanically\r\n          grabs a plastic bin liner from underneath the sink.\r\n', "          Paul opens the wardrobe. Pulls out Anna's clothes. Stuffs\r\n          them into the bin liner. He notices the Kitschy Doll.\r\n          Shoves it in with Anna's clothes.\r\n", "          Anna lies on the slab. She stares at us blankly. Her\r\n          face emotionless. Resigned. Eliot rinses her hair now\r\n          dyed back to brown. She slowly closes her eyes.\r\n          CLOSE ON RED DYE draining into the sink.\r\n          Eliot picks up the scissors. Carefully slices open\r\n          Anna's red slip. Delicately peels the slip off her body.\r\n          Anna doesn't react.\r\n          CLOSE ON Anna. She opens her eyes. Confused.     She turns\r\n          her head... she's in PAUL'S BEDROOM.\r\n", '          Paul lies in bed next to her watching her intently.     He\r\n          looks different. Clean shaven.

He's miles away.\r\n", "                       What the hell's wrong with you?\r\n                              (holds his fingers close together)\r\n                       You're this close to fucking up your\r\n                       career.\r\n", "                              (suddenly looks up)\r\n                       You know what he told me? He told me\r\n                       Anna's alive.\r\n", "                       You didn't believe him did you?\r\n", "                       No.   Of course not.\r\n          Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The\r\n          ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts\r\n          hypnotically across the screen.\r\n", "                       It's just... I'm having these...\r\n", '                       What?\r\n', '                       Nothing.   Forget it.\r\n', "          Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a\r\n          ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves\r\n          Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her\r\n          slab watching Eliot work.\r\n", '          Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face\r\n          partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.\r\n', "          Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's\r\n          face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of\r\n          wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.\r\n", "                       What's that for?\r\n          Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He\r\n          leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.\r\n", "                    His mouth.   To keep it closed.\r\n          Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back\r\n          Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the\r\n          lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He\r\n          picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.\r\n", "                    Now his eyes.\r\n          He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids\r\n          over them. Glues the eyelids together.\r\n", "                    Is this how you'll prepare my body?\r\n          Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly.\r\n", "                    No. There's no need. I had to rebuild\r\n                    his face. You're still beautiful.\r\n", '                    Does he have family?\r\n', "                    Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later.\r\n          Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.\r\n", "                    My mother... She didn't cry did she?\r\n                    When she came to see me?\r\n", "                           (shakes his head)\r\n                    I'm sorry.\r\n", '                    And Paul?\r\n', "                    It's not important anymore.\r\n", '                    I need to know.\r\n', "                    No.    He didn't cry.\r\n          We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes.\r\n", "                    I knew he wouldn't.     He always got\r\n                    upset when I cried.     He said crying\r\n                    never helped.\r\n          Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily\r\n          against the slab. As if she's about to fall.\r\n", '                    You should rest.\r\n          He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down.\r\n', "                    You're getting weaker.    It's almost time.\r\n          Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him.\r\n", '                    Can I ask you something?\r\n', '                    Yes.   Of course.\r\n', '                    Why do we die?\r\n          A long beat.\r\n', "                    To make life important.\r\n          Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable\r\n          child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna\r\n          sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering.\r\n          But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with\r\n          AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently\r\n          in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves\r\n          to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the\r\n          shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.\r\n", '          Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes\r\n          over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a\r\n          ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More\r\n          ominous. Claustrophobic.\r\n', '          CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back.\r\n          Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in\r\n          thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.\r\n', '          The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.\r\n', '                    Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found\r\n                    what you were looking for.\r\n', '          Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken\r\n          to him.\r\n', '                    Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No\r\n                    need to apologize.\r\n          Eliot moves over to the wall.\r\n', "                    I really enjoyed our time together.\r\n          We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an\r\n          OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in\r\n          HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins.\r\n          Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with\r\n          their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot\r\n          touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in\r\n          the Young Man's eyes.\r\n", '                    Anthony.    Anthony. Always confused.\r\n          Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot\r\n          moves to the window.\r\n', '          A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR\r\n          parked on the driveway.\r\n', '          Eliot steps back.    Calmly continues to dry his hands.\r\n', '          Eliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway.\r\n', '                    How can I help you Officer?\r\n', "                    I'd like to see the body.\r\n", '          Eliot stops.   We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes.\r\n', "                    Frank Merano. I'm his brother.    Vincent\r\n                    Merano? I called this morning.\r\n", '                    Mr. Merano.   Yes. Of course.\r\n', "                    I hope it's no trouble. I'd just like to\r\n                    see him before the funeral.\r\n          Eliot glances at his watch.   Smiles at Vincent.\r\n", "                    It's no trouble at all.\r\n", "          Eliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent\r\n          looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her\r\n          shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.\r\n", "                    Your brother's here.\r\n          Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was\r\n          speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet\r\n          away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.\r\n", "                    He looks so peaceful. You've done a\r\n                    beautiful job. Thank-you.\r\n", "                    You should remember him as he used to be.\r\n          Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances\r\n          again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side.\r\n          Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled\r\n          for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.\r\n", "                    That's the schoolteacher isn't it?\r\n          Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.\r\n", '                    Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything\r\n                    else I can help you with?\r\n          Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot.\r\n', "                      Something's not right here.\r\n", "                             (looks up sharply)\r\n                      Not right?\r\n          Vincent nods towards Frank's body.\r\n", '                      His smile.    It was a bit more...\r\n          Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find\r\n          the right word.\r\n', '                      ...smiley.\r\n', '                      Smiley.\r\n', "          Eliot manipulates Frank's lips.\r\n", '                      A touch more.\r\n', "                      That's much better. Thank-you.\r\n", "                      I'm glad I could help.\r\n", '                      Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes\r\n                      alone with him?\r\n          Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles.\r\n', "                      No.   Not at all. I'll wait outside.\r\n          As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a\r\n          moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He\r\n          quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then\r\n          pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES\r\n          HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body.\r\n          As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against\r\n          the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls\r\n          back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.\r\n", "                      I'm sorry.    I didn't see...\r\n", "          Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly\r\n          askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks\r\n          coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence.\r\n", "                      Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll\r\n                      see you at the service. Thanks again.\r\n          Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The\r\n          door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.\r\n", "                      I just told you. That was your brother.\r\n                             (turns to Frank)\r\n                      You had an accident. You're dead. Why\r\n                      do you people never listen to me?\r\n          Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut.\r\n", "                      No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse.\r\n          Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks\r\n          with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.\r\n", "                      I take care of each of you as if you were\r\n                      my children. I wash the shit from your\r\n                      bodies. I dress you. I do everything to\r\n                      make you look more beautiful than when\r\n                      you were alive. And what do you do?\r\n          Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red\r\n          lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.\r\n", "                      You argue with me. As if it were my fault\r\n                      you're dead. As if I was to blame.\r\n                             (slams down the lipstick.)\r\n                      What? You're not talking to me now? You\r\n                      don't want to?\r\n", '          The crudely drawn bright red lips.     Clown-like circles of\r\n          rouge. Gaudy and macabre.\r\n', "                      You don't talk because you have nothing\r\n                      to say. And you have nothing to say\r\n                      because you're a corpse.\r\n", "          From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to\r\n          talk again.\r\n", "                       No. Now I don't want to talk to you\r\n                       anymore.\r\n", "          The curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless,\r\n          in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway.\r\n", "                       I'm off to school now.\r\n          His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment\r\n          she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway.\r\n", '          Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush.\r\n          Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance.\r\n', "          The service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously\r\n          through the empty room to an open casket. He glances\r\n          back, then leans over the coffin.\r\n", '          Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His\r\n          face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.\r\n', "          Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches\r\n          into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand.\r\n          In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops\r\n          surprised. Watches Jack intently.\r\n", "                       What's it like? Are you afraid?\r\n", '                       Jack.\r\n', '          Jack turns quickly.    Eliot stands over him.\r\n', "                    You have empathy with the dead. You're\r\n                    drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to\r\n                    you. It's a rare gift.\r\n          Jack can't look Eliot in the eye.\r\n", '                    I know you saw Anna.\r\n          Jack hesitates.   Then nods his head.\r\n', "                    You're frightened by it. I was scared\r\n                    too the first time. But you shouldn't\r\n                    be. Christ had the same gift. He raised\r\n                    Lazarus and spoke to the dead.\r\n", '                    You spoke to Miss Bryant?\r\n', '                    Yes.\r\n', "                    You've spoken to others?\r\n", '                    Yes.    Many others.\r\n', '                    Who was the first one you spoke to?\r\n          A long beat.\r\n', "                    My mother.\r\n          Jack looks up sharply.   Eliot's words have clearly struck a\r\n          chord.\r\n", "                    You shouldn't be afraid.\r\n", "                    The others. They won't understand.    They\r\n                    don't see what we see.\r\n", '                    I can help you. I can teach you.\r\n', '          Anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. Eliot places a bunch\r\n          of tulips on the trolley. Turns on a CD. CLASSICAL MUSIC\r\n          fills the room as before. He moves over to Anna. Gently\r\n          Pulls away the sheet.\r\n', '                    Your fingernails are dirty.\r\n          Eliot smiles.    Examines his nails.\r\n', '                    Your hands are normally so clean.\r\n', "                    I've been gardening.\r\n          He walks over to the sink.      Scrubs his nails.\r\n", '                    Is it sunny outside?\r\n          Eliot fills a bowl with water.     Carries it to the slab.\r\n', '                    Yes.    The tulips love the sun.\r\n', '                    I miss the sun.\r\n          Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on\r\n          his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the\r\n          bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.\r\n', '                    Are they your favorite flower?\r\n', "                    Tulips?    Yes. I think so.\r\n          Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit.\r\n          Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.\r\n", "                    I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies.\r\n                    Don't they symbolize death?\r\n", '                    No.    They symbolize purity.\r\n          He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her\r\n          body.

He\r\n                    thought I didn't love him.\r\n", '                    Did you?\r\n', '                    He was the only one I ever loved. But I\r\n                    never told him that. And then he stopped\r\n                    loving me.\r\n          Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision.\r\n', "                    What would you do if you had another\r\n                    chance?\r\n          Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it.\r\n          Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold\r\n          light. Anna doesn't move.\r\n", "                    Well?   Isn't this what you wanted?\r\n          Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and\r\n          rises from the slab.\r\n", '          Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the\r\n          driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress\r\n          and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.\r\n', "          Anna approaches her mother's house.    Paul opens the door.\r\n          He's not surprised to see her.\r\n          Beatrice stands just behind him.     A black shawl over her\r\n          head and arms.\r\n", '          In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD\r\n          WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical\r\n          black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in\r\n          different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like\r\n          an ANCIENT PRAYER.\r\n', '          Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down\r\n          we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly\r\n          flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily.\r\n          The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning\r\n          over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell\r\n          their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER.\r\n          Through the chaos of words we begin to make out...\r\n', "                    Spit it out.\r\n          Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her\r\n          mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING.\r\n", '                    Spit it out.\r\n          Anna spits out... white maggots.     She gags again.   Closes\r\n          her eyes. Shakes her head.\r\n', '                    No.\r\n', "          Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room.\r\n          She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.\r\n", "                    I thought you were different. You all\r\n                    say you're scared of death. But the\r\n                    truth is you're more scared of life.\r\n          Eliot switches off the lights.\r\n", "                    I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over.\r\n", "          Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as\r\n          he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's\r\n          room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out\r\n          of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.\r\n", "          Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home.\r\n          It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the\r\n          wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.\r\n          He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge.\r\n          Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches\r\n          down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.\r\n", '          Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.\r\n', "          Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's\r\n          caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly.\r\n          A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.\r\n", "                    What the fuck are you doing here?\r\n          The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom.\r\n", "                    I'm taking you home.\r\n", '          CLOSE ON black earth.   A trowel digs into the soil.\r\n', "          We pull back. Jack's just finished digging a hole in the\r\n          flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid.\r\n          The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly\r\n          replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He\r\n          pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the\r\n          faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.\r\n", "                     Don't be scared. It's better this way.\r\n", "          Eliot lies on his bed. Dressed in a dark suit. He hasn't\r\n          slept at all. His eyes rimmed red. He checks the clock on\r\n          the bedside table. It's 4.30am. He glances to the\r\n          window. Dawn light seeps into the room.\r\n", '          Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters\r\n          in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still\r\n          covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the\r\n          delicate flowers.\r\n', "          Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress.   Her eyes closed.\r\n          Eliot enters the room. He doesn't lock the door behind\r\n          him. Doesn't turn the lights on. Doesn't change into\r\n          his mortician smock.\r\n          He approaches the slab. The violets in his hand. Pulls\r\n          over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets\r\n          on the steel trolley beside her.\r\n          He looks at her intently. For the first time he seems\r\n          uncertain. Vulnerable. As if questioning himself.\r\n          After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the\r\n          door. He's about to close the door behind him...\r\n", "                     I don't even know your name.\r\n", '          Her eyes still closed.\r\n', '          Eliot pauses.   Too confused to look back at her.\r\n', "                       It's...\r\n", "                       It's not important.\r\n          He closes the door.\r\n", "          CLOSE ON Beatrice's face.    Her eyes closed.\r\n          A HAND delicately powders her forehead. As if she's\r\n          being prepared for her own funeral. We pull back.\r\n          Beatrice, dressed in black, sits in front of a mirror.\r\n          Diane applies her make-up. Beatrice opens her eyes.\r\n", '          Paul, badly shaven, leans against the washbasin. Wearing\r\n          a crumpled black suit. Staring vacantly in the mirror.\r\n', '          Anna lies in a casket as Eliot arranges her hair.\r\n', "                       It's time now.\r\n          She looks up smiling. Eliot positions her hands,\r\n          entwining her fingers.\r\n", '                       You have to look beautiful for your\r\n                       funeral.\r\n          He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID.\r\n          Fills the syringe.\r\n', '          We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.\r\n', '                       This will relax your muscles.

Picks up a mirror.    Hands it to Anna.\r\n', '          Anna looks peaceful.    Beautiful.    Serene.\r\n', '                       Is this the end?\r\n', "                       The last part is the most difficult.\r\n                       You'll have to face it alone. But you'll\r\n                       be at peace soon.\r\n          Anna nods.    SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror.\r\n          She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on\r\n          the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.\r\n", '          Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror, then at Anna.\r\n', '                       You lied to me.\r\n', "                       Anna.

Anna tries to\r\n          raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.\r\n", "                       You're still clutching onto life. Don't\r\n                       give in to your fears. You're so close.\r\n          Anna's fading away.    Her hand drops limply to her side.\r\n", '                       Why did you lie to me?\r\n          She stops struggling.    Stares blankly at us.\r\n          Eliot looks at her for   a moment. Sadly. Regretfully.\r\n          He picks up a Polaroid   camera. The flash explodes in a\r\n          blinding white light.    He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels\r\n          off the front and fans   it in the air. Then...\r\n', "          ...delicately closes Anna's eyelids.\r\n", '                      Good bye Anna.\r\n', "          Anna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her\r\n          casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies.\r\n          Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane\r\n          beside her.

Then Jack. He\r\n          stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the\r\n          Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin.\r\n", '          Anna looks serene.\r\n', "          Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently\r\n          slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger.\r\n          Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.\r\n", '                       What is it?\r\n', "                       She's so cold.\r\n          Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes.

It's\r\n          almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look\r\n          then turns and stares at Paul.\r\n          As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket.\r\n          Begins to screw down the lid.\r\n", "          It's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING.      Anna's eyes\r\n          FLICKER OPEN then close again.\r\n", "          Just then Paul turns back sharply.      As if he sensed\r\n          Anna's reaction inside the casket.      Tom gently stops him.\r\n", "                              (shakes his head)\r\n                       She's at peace now.\r\n          Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows\r\n          Tom to lead him away.\r\n          Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room.\r\n          Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger.\r\n", '          A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.\r\n', '          Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a\r\n          pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the\r\n          blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.\r\n', "                      Don't be scared. It's better this way.\r\n          Eliot turns.   Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby.\r\n", "          The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open\r\n          grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.\r\n", "          Anna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out.\r\n          But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat.\r\n", '          The TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin.\r\n          Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could\r\n          sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.\r\n', '                      We have but a short time to live.

The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful.\r\n          She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood.\r\n', "          The grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles\r\n          flicker on top. In the b.g.

So why don't\r\n                    you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran.\r\n                    Find out whether she's alive or dead.\r\n          Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels.   Shoves him against the wall.\r\n", "                    You twisted fuck.\r\n          The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot\r\n          whispers in Paul's ear.\r\n", "                    You don't have much time left.\r\n          Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.\r\n", "                    Please.   Paul. You're not well.\r\n          Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly.\r\n          Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out.\r\n", '          Paul sprints across the lawn to his car.\r\n', "          Paul slips his key into the ignition.   His hand's shaking.\r\n", "          Eliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF.\r\n", "          We can't see a thing. But we can hear Anna's SHORT\r\n          SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately\r\n          SCRATCHING at the coffin lid.\r\n", '          Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as\r\n          he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a\r\n          slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.\r\n', "                     Come on.   Come on.\r\n          He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind\r\n          curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner.\r\n          A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's\r\n          momentarily blinded.\r\n", "          Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any\r\n          traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago.\r\n          Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the\r\n          car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.\r\n", '          An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.     Blasts past.\r\n', '          Paul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He\r\n          frowns. Where did the ambulance go?\r\n', '          We see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight.\r\n          The cemetery next to it.\r\n', "          Eliot's White Van sits by the side of the road.\r\n", "          Paul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the\r\n          distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.\r\n", "          Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then\r\n          the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes\r\n          away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.\r\n          Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody.\r\n          Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her\r\n          body slumps limply like a rag doll.\r\n", "                    Anna.   I'm here. Please God.     Anna.\r\n          He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life\r\n          left in her. He's about to give up when...\r\n          Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.\r\n          Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.\r\n", '                    Paul?\r\n', '                    Baby.   Thank God.\r\n          Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round.\r\n          Dazed. Turns back to Paul.\r\n', '                    You came back for me.\r\n', "                    I came back for you.     You're safe now.\r\n", '                    Promise?\r\n', "                    Promise.\r\n          Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He\r\n          turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's\r\n          something unnerving about the silence.\r\n          Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.\r\n          Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the\r\n          dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.\r\n", '                    Anna?\r\n          Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone\r\n          crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.\r\n', "                    Anna!\r\n          Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.\r\n          Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees\r\n          appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his\r\n          jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on\r\n          Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.\r\n", '          We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.\r\n          Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC\r\n          fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.\r\n', '          Paul frantically runs into the parking lot.    Still\r\n          calling out for Anna.\r\n', "                    Anna!\r\n          Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on.    Paul\r\n          looks at the car nervously.\r\n          He heads over to it.   Apprehensive.   Then... the car door\r\n          slowly CLICKS open.\r\n          Paul stops.   Stares into the car.   There's no one there.\r\n", '          Through the windshield we see Paul approach the car.\r\n          He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he\r\n          switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly\r\n          around him revealing...\r\n          ... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.\r\n', '                    Are we going home?\r\n          Paul turns sharply.    Stunned.   Anna moves towards him.\r\n', '                    Or do you want to make love here?\r\n', "                    Where did you go?\r\n          Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on.\r\n          We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.\r\n", "                    I've been waiting for you.    I missed you\r\n                    so much.\r\n          A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his\r\n          lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A\r\n          drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls\r\n          like a flower. Spreading out over the material.\r\n", '                    I love you.   I always did.\r\n          Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately.\r\n          Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.\r\n', '                    What was that?\r\n          Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.\r\n', "                    It's only the scissors...\r\n          We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.    Anna's just\r\n          interested in his lips.\r\n", '                    Scissors?   What scissors?\r\n', '                    Scissors. For your clothes.    Eliot just\r\n                    put them on the table.\r\n          Paul pulls back.   Terrified.\r\n', "                    You're safe now. We're finally together.\r\n          A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like\r\n          the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.\r\n", '          Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light.\r\n          Slowly the room comes into focus...\r\n', '          Eliot stands over Paul holding a pair of BLOODY SCISSORS.\r\n          Paul looks down. His white shirt soaked with blood, the\r\n          material sliced open.\r\n', '                    Where am I?\r\n', '          He talks with difficulty.   His breath labored.\r\n', "                    You're in a funeral home.\r\n", "                    You're dead.\r\n", "                    I'm not dead.\r\n          Jack appears at Eliot's side.\r\n", '                    You had a car accident. You swerved off\r\n                    the road. On the way to the cemetery.\r\n                    Hit a tree.\r\n', '                    I saw Anna.    You buried her alive.\r\n', "                    I'm sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it\r\n                    to the cemetery. You never saw Anna.\r\n                    You're dead.\r\n          Paul's glazed eyes widen in shock.\r\n", "                    I'm not dead.\r\n          Eliot speaks calmly.    Soothingly.\r\n", "                    Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord\r\n                    pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly\r\n                    dying. Your body's already decomposing.\r\n", "                    I'm not dead.\r\n          Eliot sighs wearily.    He's had this conversation many\r\n          times before.\r\n", "                    You people.    You all say the same thing.\r\n          Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further\r\n          away. Paul closes his eyes.\r\n", "                    I'm not dead.\r\n"]
