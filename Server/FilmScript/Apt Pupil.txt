This is the kind\n     of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful\n     suburban community of Santo Donato.  Todd gets off his bike and\n     heads up the front steps.  On the way, he bends down to pick up\n     the L.A. Times.\n\n     Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the\n     door bell.  The first reads: "ARTHUR DENKER".  The second reads:\n', '\n     Todd RINGS the bell.  Nothing.  He looks at his watch.  It is\n     twelve past ten.  He RINGS again, this time longer.  Still\n     nothing.  Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his\n     watch as he does so.  After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING,\n     a voice is heard from within.\n\n', "             All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it\n             go!\n\n     Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle.\n     Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT\n     DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there\n     in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth,\n     he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein.\n     Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly\n     cannot.\n\n", "                    (continuing)\n             A boy.

There is no arguing with crazy\n             people.\n\n     Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door.  He\n     stops at the threshold of the house and turns.  He is holding\n     the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the\n     other.  He looks straight ahead.  A moment later, Todd steps\n     into the house. \n\n\n', "\n     Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old\n     man.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary.  Todd looks\n     around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil\n     painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle.

Well, not you \n             personally, but, ...well, it's something I \n             learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher,\n             Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our\n             One Great Interest in life.  You know, the \n             thing that would really grab us.  Once we did\n             that, everything would fall into place.  Like\n             hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but \n             collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I\n             guess there's no money in that, so she has to \n             be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start\n             thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing\n             happened.  Until the following summer, in \n             Ronny Pegler's garage.

We see that the boxes are filled with\n     old war magazines.  Ronny tosses several of them to the ground \n     as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse.  Ronny selects\n     one Penthouse and rifles through it.  He discards it a moment\n     later. \n\n", '             One of these has three girls doing it ', ".\n\n     But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention.

I mean,\n             you can't just say what happened like the\n             magazines did and leave it at that.

He knows he has crossed into\n     dangerous territory from which there is no going back.  But \n     after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The\n     sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes\n     a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear\n     him in the kitchen. \n\n', "             It takes eight good matches, they're called \n             compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get \n             accepted in court. \n\n", '             Is that right? \n\n\n     ', ": EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY\n\n     Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly.  He pulls\n     the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the\n     mailbox for prints. \n\n", "             Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The \n             first I figured were the mailman's.  Once I \n             knew what I was looking for, yours were easy\n             to spot. \n\n\n", '\n', '             You should be a detective. \n\n     The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the \n     kitchen.  Drinks being poured.  Todd begins to move slowly\n     toward the kitchen. \n\n', "             Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it. \n\n\n", '\n     He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks. \n\n', '             I found fourteen compares. \n\n     Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass\n     of bourbon.  He hands the tumbler to Todd, who brings it up to\n     his lips and hesitates. \n\n', '             You have some. \n\n', '             Good ', '.\n\n     He snatches the cup and swallows twice. \n\n', "             You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee\n             Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a\n             smiling cow. \n\n     Todd pauses and then begins to drink. \n\n", "                    (more to himself than Todd)\n             ...And two missing children.\n                    (pause) \n             Boy what you have done, I have to explain\n             this to you because clearly you don't\n             understand, what you have done is a\n             violation. \n\n", '             A violation? \n\n', '             Yes. \n\n', '             Kind of like those experiments with the\n             decompression chamber.  Now, that was a\n             violation, Dussander. \n\n', '             That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand\n             it. \n\n', '             You what? \n\n', '             I demand -- \n\n', '             You demand nothing from me.  Ever.  Get it?\n\n     Pause. \n\n', '             Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for \n             the last time.  My name is Arthur Denker.  It\n             has never been anything else.  It has never\n             even been Americanized.  If you must know,\n             and apparently you must, I was named by my\n             father who greatly admired the stories of\n             Arthur Conan Doyle.  I did serve in the \n             reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, \n             when I was first married, I supported Hitler.\n             I supported him most, I suppose, because for\n             the first time in years there was work and\n             there was tobacco. ...Would you like a \n             cigarette? \n\n', "             No.  My dad used to smoke.  Mom made him\n             quit.  Now he's addicted to Nicorette...\n             that's nicotine gum. \n\n     Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match\n     from a cabinet.  He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd. \n\n", "             Nicotine gum. \n\n     Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives \n     neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. \n     He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns\n     and continues.\n\n", '             Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, \n             directing phantom armies at the whim of his \n             astrologer.  He even gave his dog, Blondi, a \n             death capsule.  On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment\n             surrendered to the Americans.  I remember\n             that a private named Gonzales gave me a\n             chocolate bar.  I wept. \n\n     Bored, Todd sinks into a chair at the table.\n\n', '             I was interned at Essen where I was treated\n             very well.  We listened to the Nuremberg\n             trials on the radio and when Goering \n             committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of\n             schnaps and got drunk.  When I was released, \n             I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works\n             until I retired in 1963.  In 1967 I emigrated\n             here, to California, and became a U.S. \n             Citizen.  I am as American as you are.  I \n             vote.  No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no ', '\n\n\n\n']
