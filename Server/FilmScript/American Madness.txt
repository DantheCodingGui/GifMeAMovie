Men \n                         like Jones? Last week you made him an \n                         extra loan of fifty thousand dollars. \n                         Do you call that intelligent banking?\n', "                         He can't pay his bills. How do you expect \n                         him to pay us?\n", "                         That's a fair question, Schultz. Now \n                         let's see how bad a risk Jones is. What's \n                         his history? He's been a successful \n                         business man for thirty-five years. \n                         Two years ago business started falling \n                         off. Today Jones needs money, and if \n                         he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy \n                         and throws nine hundred men out of work. \n                         Answer - unemployment.\n", "                         As he listens intently, Dickson's voice \n                         coming in:\n", "                         It also means his creditors aren't paid. \n                         They're in trouble. They go to banks \n                         and are turned down . . . more bankruptcies \n", '                         As he continues:\n', "                         It's a vicious circle, my friends, and \n                         the only place to cure it is right here \n                         at the source. Help Jones and you help \n                         the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes \n                         to me, I ask myself two questions. First \n                         - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he \n                         as good a business man as he was before? \n                         And the answer is - he's better .\n", "                         Showing his reaction, as part of Dickson's \n                         speech comes over scene:\n", '                         He is not only older and wiser, but \n                         his present trouble has taught him precaution. \n                         In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is \n                         no risk. Neither are the thousands of \n                         other Joneses throughout the country \n', "                         To intercut with Dickson's speech.\n", "                         To intercut with Dickson's speech.\n", "                         To intercut with Dickson's speech.\n", '                         The group, as Dickson concludes his \n                         speech.\n', "                         It's they who built this nation up to \n                         the richest in the world, and it's up \n                         to the banks to give them a break.
