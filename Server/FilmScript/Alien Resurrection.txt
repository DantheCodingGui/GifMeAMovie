['Alien Resurrection \n\n\n\n', "\nWe sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes \ninto view:\n\nthe U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically \njust beyond Pluto's orbit.\n\nWe TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and \n\n", '\nalong the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two \nguards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful \nshockrifles, expressions empty and cold.\n\n', '\nAlong a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, \nlights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. \n\nAs we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, \nthen another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a \nCryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.\n\nStill TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass \nencased in a clear, aspic-like gel. \n\nTubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine.\n\nAs we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can \nsee what might even be a face.\n\nEyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming.\n\n', '\nA birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen.  \nSharp contrast to what we have seen before.\n\nThere is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven \nor eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair.\n\n', "\nMy mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there \nare.\n\nThe girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her \nchest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see.\n\nShe looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty \nyards away.\n\nThe girl's expression becomes perplexed.\n\nShe slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, \nwriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more \ndistraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout.\n\nThe sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another.  \nShe looks down in  growing horror and sees:\n\nBlood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, \na sea of blood now, dark, thick.\n\nThe girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely \ncovered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she \nfinally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth.\n\n", '\n', '\nInstruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure.\n\nScientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic.\n\nWe can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the \nsize of a man, and in a new case.\n\nThe camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a \nsecond one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat.\n\n', '\n', '\nTiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning \ninto another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving \nuntil we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of \ndark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us...\n\nANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream \nit keeps shifting.\n\nShe opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless.\n\nShe reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard.\n\nTearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides.\n\n', '\n', '\nAnd the cause of this dream becomes apparant:\n\n', '\nbeing cut open with a lasersaw.\n\nWe see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it.  \nAnd her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her \nface her identity is unmistakable.\n\nAround her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a \nyoung and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands \na bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN.\n\n', '\nCareful ... ready with the amnio...\n\nGediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it.  \nPulls apart the chest.\n\n', "\nThere she is...\n\nHe says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a \nsleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at \nsevering umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest.\n\n", '\nHere we go.\n\nHe holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator \nfilled with  amniotic fluid.\n\nThe alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of \nhis grasp.\n\n', '\nWatch it!\n\nEverybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from \nhim, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the \ntop rapidly.\n\nEverybody looks at each other for a moment.\n\n', '\nWell ...\n\n', "\nThe host?\n\nA surgeon looks at Ripley's readings.\n\n", '\nDoing fine.\n\nGediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods.\n\n', '\nSew her back up.\n\nGediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the \nalien.\n\n', "\nWell, that went as well as could be expected--\n\nRipley's hand LASHES OUT, GRABS the surgeon's forearm.  He yells in \npain as her fingers dig into him, the others scramble knocking things \nover and we HEAR HIS BONE CRACKING.\n\n", '\n', "\nSudden stillness.\n\nRipley crouches in the middle of a small, dark chamber.  She's wide \neyed, staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia. Hair tangled \nand wild. But at least she's not so  blue as before.\n\nThe only light on her comes from directly above, from a thick pane of \nglass in the center of the ceiling.\n\n", '\nA guard stands on the floor above, looking into the cell through the \nsquare of glass in  the floor, directly above Ripley.\n\n(We see other panes of glass lining the floor, indicating more cells \nbelow.)\n\n', '\nShe is still for a long while.  Then she lifts her hands, looking at \nthem.\n\nTouches her face, her skin.\n\nShe fingers her tunic, pulls down the neck.  There is a scar running \nalong her chest.\n\nShe fingers it thoughtfully. -\n\nShe looks at her forearm.  Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the \nnumber 8.\n\nShe looks up, her face unreadable.\n\n', '\n', '\nRipley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her.\n\nHe deposits it in a test beaker, studies her eyes.\n\nWren enters, looking at a chart.\n\n', "\nHow's our number Eight today?\n\n", '\nAppears to be in good health...\n\n', '\n(noticing his tone)\n\nHow good?\n\n', '\nExtraordinary. As in, completely off our projected charts.\n\n(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue.  See the recession?\n\n', '\nThis is from --\n\n', '\nYesterday!\n\n', '\nThis is good.  This is very good.\n\n', "\nI'd like to run some tests: strength, coordination...  We're not \nlooking at a normal cloning arc.\n\n", '\nApproved.\n\nWren goes up to Ripley, studies her face with satisfaction.\n\n', "\nWell, it looks like you're going to make us all very proud.\n\nShe grabs his throat with dazzling speed, applying deadly pressure as \nshe  brings his face to hers.  Her eyes are burn but lost.\n\n", '\nWhy?\n\n', "\nOh my God...\n\nHe is as wide eyed as WREN, and he isn't having his windpipe crushed.\n\nAfter a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the \nalarm.\n\nKlaxons, red light fire up.\n\nA guard rushes in, levels his weapon at Ripley.  After a moment of \nstaring him down, she opens her hand.  Wren falls to his knees gasping.\n\nThe guard FIRES his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes \nout and sends her flying back into the corner.\n\n", "\nNo! No! I'm all right!\n\nThe guards keep their weapons -- 'burners', these shockrifles are \ncalled -- leveled  at Ripley. She has recovered from the shock quickly, \nsits crumpled in the corner, looking at nothing in particular.\n\nRIPLEY (wearily)\n\nWhy...?\n\n", '\n', '\nWren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests \nRipley.\n\nWith them is General PEREZ, the man in charge this boat. Ramrod \nstraight and about  as gruff as you would expect, he stares at Ripley \nsuspiciously.\n\n', "\nThe scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them: house, dog, \nboat.\n\nRipley gives answers we can't hear through the glass, looking pissed \noff and bored.\n\n", "\nIt's unprecedented.\n\n", "\nTotally!  She's operating at a completely adult capacity.\n\n", '\nAnd her memories?\n\n', "\nThere are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance.\n\n", "\nShe's freaked.\n\nWren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance.\n\n", '\n"It" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional \nautism.\n\nCertain reactions....\n\nPerez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall.\n\n', '\n', '\nThe two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second \nobservation room.\n\n', "\nBut the thing is, we can't terminate her. It.\n\n", "\nYou haven't told me what you think has caused this.\n\nCloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought \nto adult term.  I'm right?\n\n", "\nThere's been cases..\n\n", '\nNot like this.\n\n', "\nWell, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a \ncollective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like \ninstinct, only  more complex structurally.\n\n", "\nIn some cases. You're talking about the alien.\n\n", '\nYes.\n\n', "\nYou promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing.\n\n", "\nIt's not like the other ones..\n\nPerez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second \nobservation room door opens..\t\n\nHe steps in, the other two right behind him.\n\n", '\n', '\nDarker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards \nby the door.\n\nApart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others.\n\n', '\nBut there is some genetic mix.\n\n', '\nYes.\n\n', '\nWill there be further mutation?\n\n', "\nMutation isn't exactly... I don't think so.\n\n", "\nThat's one of the things we need to study.\n\n", "\nAll right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for \nGod's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises.\n\nAnd as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the \nridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at \nthe back of his head.\n\nThe reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, \nstops it.\n\nAs it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the \nalien's face.\n\nIts bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off.\n\nPerez turns to look at it with the others.\n\n", '\nIt took a hell of a lot to get us here.\n\n', '\nNo shit.\n\nWren shoots him another look.\n\n', "\nHow soon before this one's ovulating?\n\n", '\nDays.\n\n', '\nIs that normal?\n\n', "\nNo way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated.\n\n(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies.\n\n", "\nThey're coming.  Soon.\n\n", '\n', '\nRipley sits across from Gediman. He is eating at a good pace - Ripley, \nhowever, has stopped.

They'll be invaluable once we've \nharnessed them.\n\n", "\nIt's a cancer.  You can't teach it tricks.\n\nThis stops Wren, and he retreats silently.

The hatch \natop the ship slowly  opens. One by one the crew files out. Seeing them \nen masse, we get a clearer view of  what separates them from this \nEnvironment.  They're not wearing uniforms.  They're an  eclectic, \nfiercely indivualist group, their look varied -- spots of bright color \nshowing  through militarian space gear.  Johner's bright tuorquise \nbowling shirt.  Elgy's and St Just's floorlength leather dusters.  Even \nVriess's chair stands out as he wheels down the platform.\n\nWhat they have in common is the toughness, the wary eyes, leathery \nskin.  The cool readiness to kill.  These guys are smugglers.  A long \nwhile ago, you'd have called them pirates\n\nAll eight of them emerge, one by one, looking around them.  They file \npast the silent, uniformed soldiers.  The last one suddenly puts a hand \non Johner's jacket, stops him.\n\nThere is a bulge under it.
