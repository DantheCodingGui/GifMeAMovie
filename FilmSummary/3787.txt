\nIn 1976, Steven Spurrier, a sommelier in Paris, comes to the Napa Valley to take the best he can find to Paris for a blind taste test against French wine. He meets Jim Barrett, whose Chateau Montelena is mortgaged to the hilt as Jim perfects his chardonnay. There\'s strain in Jim\'s relations with his hippie son Bo and his foreman Gustavo, a Mexican farmworker\'s son secretly making his own wine.
