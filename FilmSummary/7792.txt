\nExasperated from bratty, ungrateful and self-centered kids, Santa\'s elves decide to go on strike, and the elves\' demands on Santa become rather unreasonable. In desperation, Santa brings six mischievous teens from the mall to help. After several unsuccessful attempts to escape, including stealing Santa\'s sleigh, Santa sends the teens to watch "naughty/nice" videos where they have to vote on kids\' behavior. All seems fun to the teens until they see videos of their own behavior and have to vote themselves naughty. One teen, upset and thinking his behavior as nice, kidnaps a sleeping elf as a last chance effort to force Santa into sending him home.
