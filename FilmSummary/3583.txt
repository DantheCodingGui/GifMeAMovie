\nMeet Franklin Hart (\'Coleman\'). The biggest \'sexist egotistical lying hypocritical bigot\' boss on the planet. He thrills in taking advantage of his head female office staff; humiliating, downplaying, and condescending against them whenever conveniently possible, particularly his top assistant Violet (\'Tomlin\'). Long exhausted over his gruesome bullishness, Violet, alongside coworkers Doralee (\'Parton\') and Judy (\'Fonda\') comprise comical methods of "doing him in", when a freak incident occurs. They then manage to kidnap Hart and trap him in his own house, while assuming control of his department, and productivity leaps. But just how long can they keep him tied up?                ',
