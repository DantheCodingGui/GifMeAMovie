"\nCritically wounded and lying unconscious in a Mumbai hospital, ACP Yashvardhan of the Narcotics Control Bureau reflects on his life and his love-affair with Maya. With the assistance of the Commissioner as well as his colleagues, Atul, Kamlesh and Mahesh Pandey, and an informer, Arvind Shetty, he was able to apprehend drug-dealers in Kutch, Gujarat; Jalandhar, Punjab, as well as in Himachal Pradesh. Unknowingly, he paved the way for Vasu Anna Reddy to become the sole drug-dealer and invite his Mombasa-based brother, Vishnu, to join him.
