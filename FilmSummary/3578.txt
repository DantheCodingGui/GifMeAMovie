\nParole officer Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) has only a few weeks left before retirement and wishes to finish out the cases he\'s been assigned.

Jack is initially reluctant to indulge Stone in the coarse banter he wishes to pursue and feels little sympathy for the prisoner\'s pleads for an early release.
