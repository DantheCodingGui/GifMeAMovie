\nHere\'s the thing! Viola\'s soccer team at Cornwall gets cut. She wants to join the boys team, but they do not allow girls. So she thinks "If you can\'t join them, beat them". So she does! She disguises herself as her twin brother Sebastian, and goes out for the rival school, Illyria, boys\' soccer team and makes it. Unfortunately, she didn\'t plan falling in love with her roommate Duke. But Duke has his eyes on Olivia. What makes matters worse is that Olivia starts to fall for Sebastian because he/she has a sensitive side. If things couldn\'t get more problematic, the real Sebastian (who was in London working on his music) comes home early. He arrives on campus and has no clue that he was replaced by his twin sister.                ',
