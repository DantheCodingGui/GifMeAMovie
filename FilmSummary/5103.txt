\nFollowing a near-apocalyptic zombie outbreak, humans are once again in control. If an occasional rogue zombie finds its way into everyday life, it is quickly disposed of by the authorities. In this day and age, people know how to handle "Zee\'s". The latest craze is the Zombie Safari - Zafari - a chance to go out and shoot the undead in the wild. The ultimate blood sport experience, and for many the ultimate therapeutic revenge following the losses suffered during the outbreak. Little do the vacationers realize they\'re actually in a highly controlled environment, where the zombies are always kept at a safe shooting distance. Nothing is left to chance, nothing is unplanned. So far.
