a french guy named saba is happy to present the second cover from edith piaf in this song the singer is caught by the crowd and forced in the arms of a man that could be the one to keep for a while the crowd carries them along until they separate and never find each other again most piafs songs are about broken love and this one is no different but perhaps it would be good to see a positive message of being in the moment lets try to enjoy what we have and for as long as we have it lets be grateful for the things and for the people that come into our lives even briefly life is the sum of many small moments thank you for watching and for allowing me to do this you are beautiful believe it
