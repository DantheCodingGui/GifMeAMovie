its been a year and a half since guys best friend stole his girlfriend hes wasted that time on worthless activities like watching wrestling with his friend rekindling a romance with a racist and maintaining an apartment that is a constant reminder of his failures when a cute neighbor moves in upstairs and a small crush turns into a chase guy finds himself falling in love with someone who might actually be worthwhile
