as part of a brand new strategy called shuttle bombing the 918th lands in north africa at the end of the first leg of the flight seriously short on fuel unfortunately they are forced to use an airfield that has only just been liberated from the germans by a motley group of allied units commanded by chance by col gallaghers older brother preston now the nazis are determined to take the field back in a massive counterattack not only are prestons forces badly outnumbered and outgunned but he is suffering from battle fatigue and on the verge of a breakdown to make matters worse he has commandeered his brothers fuel for his own plan to retreat leaving joes planes and his mission in grave danger nearing the end of the first leg of the shuttle raid col joe gallaghers aircraft runs low on fuel as the nearest runway at nenwadi is rained out and in deep mud and the balance of gallaghers group has moved on to magadar he decides to push his plane 100 miles further and join the rest of his group on the ground at magadar gallagher finds his brother preston in command gallagher is puzzled by the strange behavior of his brother and learns from lt col frank bailey that preston blames the obvious landing of col gallaghers planes for the subsequent german attacks and loss of his men consequently preston wants to take the gasoline from the planes and use it to move his trucks tanks and jeeps preston also plans to blow up col gallaghers planes since they are useless without fuel
