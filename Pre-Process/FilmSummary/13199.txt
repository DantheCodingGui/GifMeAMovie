when captain peacock has to report that sales on a rainy day in a gloomy conjuncture have reached rock bottom naught mr rumbold comes over to examine their selling technique and then demonstrates playing a customer with mrs slocombe how much better it would be if mr humphries greets customers peaock who fears for his position then plays an utterly impossible customer causing a shouting match just when mr grace stops by who then announces theyll either suffer a 10 pay cut or be moved to the bargains cellar where no commissions will be earned after a desperate brainstorming they decide to strike and demonstrate on the roof but peacocks plan with military precision proves precisely disastrous
