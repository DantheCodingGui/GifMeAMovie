over the last two decades tim watsonmunro has developed a high media profile particularly on television providing regular insights into the criminal mind and the frailties of human psychology but late last year tim watsonmunro fell from grace in the most spectacular fashion a police surveillance operation picked him as part of a group of melbourne high fliers who were using cocaine it transpired that the highly respected psychologist had developed a 2000 dollar a week addiction tipped off that it was likely he was about to be arrested he handed himself into the police and was fined and put on a good behaviour bond in a court case which attracted massive media coverage in his first television interview since the case watsonmunro describes cocaine as a thrill seeking activity enjoyed by successful professionals an escape from the pressures of their careers now with the help of his wife also a psychologist he is attempting to pick up the pieces of his life and what remains of his professional credibility but it emerges that his harshest critic is his nine year old daughter gabby he describes how she cross examined him about his cocaine use and made it clear just how disappointed in him she was plus sea change hes severely sea sick hes a bit slow on his feet and after five years circumnavigating the globe in a 20 year old 27 foot yacht hes finally heading back home a former real estate agent bob laughlin says it was a mid life crisis and going broke my own fault which provided the impetus for his amazing odyssey back on dry land there have been a lot of changes in the family during the long absence and it seems there may have been changes for the better in bob himself as well
