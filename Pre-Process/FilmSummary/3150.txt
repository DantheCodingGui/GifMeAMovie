eric was looking forward to possibly his last christmas with the whole camden clan but wakes up a few days earlier in heaven as a rather glenoakslike town welcomed by his loving motherinlaw and deceased people who appreciate the efforts he spent on them and their loved ones and now worry about the mortals still on earth including the camden family which is preparing for christmas even kevin and lucy are back early from frisco while in heaven eric is offered miraculous packed gifts for his family all things he generously gave his parishioners such as time for matt and mary to spend on their families and erasers for memories which poison relationships his family decides to expand the day they spend on charity like every year to three one because it feels good one as erics favorite present and one for the infant jezus the best may be his own gift everybody has a bunch of guardianangles and the experienced one in charge of his paperwork is processing an application from colleague stanley to grant his suggested wish to get more time alive on earth
