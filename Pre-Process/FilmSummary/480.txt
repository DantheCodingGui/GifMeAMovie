we find out that cole needs to go back to 2014 and find the one that got away named henri toussaint who is from haiti meanwhile dr railly working through some issues is helping with the red cross trying to stop a major plague in haiti coles job is to find the henri and find the location of the hidden lab of leland goines without running into railly after learning the identity of the scientist who survived the massacre  his name is henri toussaint  cole must travel back to 2014 to learn from him the location of the dark room the assignment is particularly difficult because cassie is also there working with the cdc to contain the outbreak of an epidemic and it is essential that cole not cross paths with her for fear of affecting the timeline theyve now established henri can only give him some ideas about the labs location however back in 2043 ramse and and a less than sympathetic whitley go on patrol after they learn someone is prowling outside the complex they run into someone ramse knows well
