\nDe-Lovely is an original musical portrait of American composer Cole Porter, filled with his unforgettable songs. In the film, Porter is looking back on his life as if it was one of his spectacular stage shows, with the people and events of his life becoming the actors and action onstage. Through elaborate production numbers and popular hits like "Anything Goes," "It\'s De-Lovely," and "Night and Day," Porter\'s elegant, excessive past comes to light - including his deeply complicated relationship with his wife and muse, Linda Lee Porter.
