when we traveled to the south by south west interactive music film  comedy festival in march of 2013 we posted a call for help on our facebook page we asked if there were any clowns in the area that might be able to help us promote the series the only reply we got was by a wonderful young circus clown from houston texas he showed us some love so we decided to profile him and introduce him to the fools idea community
