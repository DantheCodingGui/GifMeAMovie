hmas perth is a steamdriven guided missile destroyer that houses around 330 men in an area that is 133 metres long and around the size of a three storey block of flats when perth and its sister ships brisbane and hobart are decommissioned within the next 12 months it will bring to a close an era of steam ships that have been part of the navy since its foundation in 1911 australian story followed perth through its last month of service on operation proud journey as it sailed from sydney through the southern ocean to enter its namesake city perth for the last time the story of perth is told by four different men on the ship the captain the ships navigator a chief petty officer and a junior seaman for whom ironically this voyage was his first trip to sea what emerges in this portrait of life at sea is the dedication and devotion many of these men have for a ship that has been deemed too expensive and too old to retain chief hampson ive never had a civilian job so i dont know what the ford factorys like but i cant envisage factory workers working sixty hours straight at a problem just because somebody asked them to yet despite the agreement of almost every man on board that perth could respond if she were called upon the ship itself seems in its own way to be saying its time to go chief hampson im not a suspicious man but you talk to the guys around the ship and theyre all saying shes telling us shes had enough shes telling us thats the way sailors are
