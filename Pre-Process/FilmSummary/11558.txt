pepero and his friends need to get through a labyrinth of caves so they can find a faster way to get to ayacucho since climbing the surrounding mountains is too hard and dangerous three men offer to help them giving them a bat so it can guide them through the caves but it is all a trap since those men used to fool people to get lost on the caves and later steal their belongings the group separates inside the cave finding their way out but titicaca returns to the town and forces the leader of the three men to show them the correct way when they are finally reunited inside the caves the leader of the gang pulls a hidden trigger causing the explosion of a bunch of dynamite cartridges he later dies after trying to escape due to another trap set by titicaca the ceiling of the cave collapses creating a wall of stones that separates titicaca from the rest of peperos group titicaca tells them that they must move forward in their search for el dorado and leave him behind since it will take him too long to rejoin them and designates pepero as the guide of the journey with tears in their eyes pepero and his friends carry on with their voyage and end up on the other side of the mountain with the broad valley of ayacucho just in front of them below their feet
