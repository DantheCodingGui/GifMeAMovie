nelson the elephant is frustrated with doing elephanty things one day when he observes a little weaverbird he decides he wants to be a bird too and learn to fly he sets about his selfimposed task with extreme dedication and seriousness unfortunately flapping his ears and jumping doesnt work sometime later as nelson walks through the savannah in a sulk he bumps into a helicopter tree dislodging a whirling helicopter tree seed which gives nelson a brainwavethe recently inspired nelson builds a flying rotor made from three banana leaves and attaches it to a harness on his back he asks nathalie the antelope to turn the leaves to wind up the rotor and yes it works he manages to hover a foot above the ground and flutter round the savannah looking smug using his ears to steer nelson sets off on his maiden flight for a while all the animals are pleased for nelson but then he makes a great big nest in the baobab tree and tries to hatch five watermelons with disastrous results feeling sad and dejected nelson heads back to the baobob tree and sits in his nest sulking now the other animals feel sorry for nelson the snip snip bird says the animals need a big strong elephant to pull away a log that has rolled in front of the snakes burrow nelson gladly obliges then nathalie the antelopes flower garden needs watering nelson is happy again because he feels important and announces his retirement as a bird he has broken the world elephant flying record and thats enough the sky is for birds
