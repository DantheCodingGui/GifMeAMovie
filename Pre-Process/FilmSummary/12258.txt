john the baptist born to an elderly couple in answer to their prayers and a promise from god grows up to be a prophet preaching of the coming of the messiah he fulfills biblical prophecy by recognizing jesus as the promised savior and baptizing him going before the lord the moving story of john the baptist begins as elizabeth a virtuous older woman who longs for a child delights in watching a young boy playing outside her window her husband zacharias chosen to offer incense to god at the temple is visited there by the angel gabriel who tells him that his wife is to bear a son zacharias cant believe this miracle but the angels assures him all things are possible with the lord because of his disbelief zacharias suddenly falls deaf and mute unable to tell his family and neighbors what happened to him when elizabeths son is born and family members ask his name she answers  john  a name they refuse to accept since none among them share it the family asks zacharias his sons name and as he writes john on a tablet his hearing and speech are restored and he shares with them prophecy of the role his son is to play john grows up to be strong in both body and spirit living a humble life on the banks of the river jordan he preaches of the imminent coming of a savior and baptizes people in the river in the name of the messiah preparing the way for jesus all of this proves disturbing to the pharisees and their leader caiaphas who tries to convince king herod the king is reluctant but not his wife herodias even when pharisee spies question john as he preaches of the repentance he does not temper his word calling herod a sinner for taking his brothers wife this accusation drives herodias to demand johns capture and death but before this happens jesus approaches the place where john is preaching behold the lamb of god john cries out recognizing the savior about whom he has been preaching jesus asks john to baptize him and when that happens the heavens open and the holy spirit appears in the form of a dove even though his life is in danger from herodias and herod john refuses to flee declaring my work is done
