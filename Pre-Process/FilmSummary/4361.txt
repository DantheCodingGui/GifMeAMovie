Meanwhile, a landscape architect named David Abbott moves to San Francisco and, coincidentally, into Elizabeth's apartment for rent. While at the apartment, Elizabeth's spirit haunts him. She doesn't remember who she is, who her family is or what she did - All that she remembered was her apartment and where everything was.

When they get close to figuring out who she is, they eventually find love with one another and as they finally know who she really is, they learn that fate really has put them both together.
