tracey wickham set a world record that stood for nearly ten years and a commonwealth record that still stands but the olympic gold medal she was seemingly always destined for disappeared in the mess of the moscow games boycott tracey was one of our all time greats but her era ended just before huge cash rewards started flowing into the sport now thirty five and a mother of two young children tracey talks candidly to australian story about her struggles to establish a new life for herself away from the spotlight the grief of her failed marriage and the contradictions between the glittering public image and her internal sense of despair she describes her humiliation at having to queue up at social security to receive the single parents benefit which had become her only income and then bursting into tears when someone behind the counter recognised her and asked for an autograph but this story is also a celebration of her glory days when tracey left the rest of the swimming world in her wake as she dominated the pool a feat made all the more remarkable as she did it during a time when eastern bloc countries were at the height of their drug programmes possibly one of the greatest swimmers this country has ever produced we take time to remember when tracey galvanised the whole nation with her record breaking exploits in the pool
