priority is a completely automated system in which the first x number of tickets reserved are priority that way the folks who planned ahead and claimed their tickets first benefit if youre holding general tickets there is a chance youll be upgraded to priority the way that works is that as people with priority tickets cancel their tickets the system upgrades the next general ticketholders in line to priority so if 20 priority folks cancel the first 20 general ticket holders get upgraded
