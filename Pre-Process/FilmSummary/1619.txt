in 1983 the upstart united states football league usfl had the audacity to challenge the almighty nfl the new league did the unthinkable by playing in the spring and plucked three straight heisman trophy winners away from the nfl the 12team usfl played before crowds that averaged 25000 and started off with respectable tv ratings but with success came expansion and new owners this included a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the leagues founders soon the usfl was reduced to waging a desperate antitrust lawsuit against the nfl this yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business now almost a quarter of a century later academy awardnominated and peabody awardwinning director mike tollin himself once a chronicler of the league will showcase the remarkable influence of those three years on football history and attempt to answer the question who killed the usfl
