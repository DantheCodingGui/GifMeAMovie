being thirteen is difficult enough at the best of times  and jessica is not having the best of times her mother rose has recently become bedridden with a mysterious illness despite a battery of tests none of the doctors know what rose is suffering from and when or indeed if she will get better in this time of great stress for the family jessicas relationship with her stepfather mike has deteriorated sharply the only pleasant thing in jessicas life is her new friendship with the boy who is working on the farm for the summer the levelheaded and practical chris 16 chris is an invaluable ally and confidant  for jessica is beginning to believe that mike actually hates her in this frame of mind jessica is vulnerable to a very eerie experience in town to buy the weeks groceries she stumbles across a little bookshop she has never noticed before the bookseller who runs it  an elderly sprightly man with a faintly malevolent smile  selects a book especially for her jessica is even embossed on the cover but how does the bookseller know her name when jessica brings the book home she finds to her astonishment that it is the diary of a girl called jessica brown exactly her age writing exactly a hundred years before the diary makes extraordinary reading  for the coincidences between the lives of the two girls do not stop there most striking of all is the relationship between the longdead girl and her stepfather  who jessica brown detested it becomes clear in fact that jessica brown believed her stepfather was planning to kill both her and her mother in order to inherit the farm and the story is unfinished it stops abruptly on january 13th was jessica brown murdered as she feared she would be chris and jessica search out the church records for more information they find the record of jessica browns birth and her grave but no date could this old tragedy possibly have any bearing on what is happening to rose could it be that jessica brown is somehow trying to warn the presentday jessica of a terrible danger the diary begins to have a sinister sway over jessicas mind as the 13th of january comes closer in the present day jessica becomes convinced that the diary was sent to her as a warning chris has observed the development of jessicas obsession with increasing concern he steals the diary hoping that simply removing its presence might help jessica but the diary simply reappears in jessicas room  it seems neither of the children are able to destroy it until its task is done the thirteenth dawns with jessica actually sick with apprehension she is now certain that mike has been slowly poisoning rose and that he will kill her jessica too  if she doesnt take drastic action  the poison she finds in the doctors bag when he pays a house visit seems a gift straight from heaven now completely under the diarys evil influence jessica steals the poison  and pours it into the bowl of soup she has been preparing mike chris arrives in a terrible panic in continuing his investigations he has had a great stroke of luck he has stumbled across the name of jessica brown in an old newspaper but the story the article tells is not what jessica has been led to believe far from jessica brown dying at thirteen she lived to be an old woman  in an asylum she was notorious in the district at the time for the murder of her stepfather  who she believed to be trying to murder her  history is indeed about to repeat itself and in the most hideous way when the two children rush into the kitchen mike is just polishing off the last of the soup  but thats not the bowl jessica gave him they realize mike has taken the poisoned bowl upstairs  to rose in the nick of time jessica races into her mothers room and spills the poisoned soup all over the bed as the replay of the hundredyearold tragedy is thwarted the diary disappears from jessicas room as if it had never been there on the same fateful day roses illness is at last diagnosed  she can be easily treated jessica is at peace  and finally she comes to believe so is poor jessica brown
