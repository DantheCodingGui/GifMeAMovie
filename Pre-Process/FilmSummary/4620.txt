the two enduring english folkheroes are robin hood of sherwood forest and king arthur of camelot we know sherwood forest existed  its still there but where was camelot  a hundred years ago three brilliant men were prepared to risk their sanity  and their lives  to prove they knew its exact location   our story opens in victorian england vicky 14 and aidan 11 tudor are wildly excited about the imminent return of their mother and father after three years traveling abroad however the carriage that finally rumbles up the driveway contains not their parents but their beloved uncle the gentle and scholarly lance dulac 36 the tudors ship has been delayed and in their absence lance has come to take the children with him to visit his dear friend arthur leroy the earl of sackville and  perhaps even dearer to lance  the earls lovely and lively daughter guinevere 18 known to all simply as jenny to aidans particular delight the sackvilles estate gramayre is in dorset deep in cameliard the land of king arthur and his court of camelot but despite the warm welcome the children receive from the sackvilles this is far from being a simple holiday in the countryside even as they approach gramarye for the first time a mysterious wind blows up around them harsh hot and dry a terrifying roar filled with menace strangest of all although the sound of the wind is deafening it seems to move nothing in its path as the children react in fright we see their carriage is being watched through narrowed eyes by the sinister gypsy morgana jenny is particularly pleased to make the childrens acquaintance and it doesnt take long for quickwitted vicky to notice that jenny and her uncle have a certain understanding between them however lances primary purpose in coming to gramarye is the pursuit of knowledge rather than love he the earl and a third party the sombre merlyn tredinnick have been working on an excavation site within the estate for fifteen years and their work is nearing completion arthur lancelot merlin and the lady guinevere drawn together again aidan is delighted by the coincidence but as jenny points out if he remembers the legend correctly it is not necessarily a happy one  to the childrens disappointment their first day at gramarye dawns gloomily confined indoors they decide to explore the house  and very rapidly make an intriguing discovery a shrine concealed behind an ornate mirror and within it a sword and anvil beneath a medieval tapestry the face of the knight figured there is startlingly like that of their host the current lord sackville but when the children tell jenny of their discovery she is halfuneasy halfindifferent jenny indeed is the only adult in the household not in the thrall of the arthurian legend and perhaps she has good reason lance has formally proposed to her but they cannot marry until the work on the excavation site is complete as jenny tells the children if you become too obsessed with the past it leaves no time for the present and the present is where we live the second day dawns fine and with the men busy at the site jenny vicky and aidan set out for a picnic on the lake aidan who true to form is paddling his own canoe is ahead and out of sight of the others when he finds himself being dragged offcourse he is horrified to see guiding the wayward canoe a womans arm clothed in white rising from the waters of the lake leaping ashore in terror aidan sees a figure in white beckoning him on  and as if hypnotized he sets out to follow her the modern day king knight and necromancer have uncovered an astonishing find a roman tessellation perfectly preserved and in the center the figure of a medieval monarch  king arthur as professor dulac gravely observes this is potentially the most dangerous archaeological discovery ever made  because it utterly defies both time and history echoing the obsession in august cont knight in the childrens tapestry the face of the king is  that of the victorian arthur leroy into this solemn conclave comes aidan hot dusty frightened and whooping for breath the earl wheels on him in fury  the nature of their work has always been contained in complete secrecy sobbing and distressed still under the partial thrall of a magic he does not understand aidan bolts away through the forest with a mysterious voice singing threateningly in his head the king needs him the king needs him jenny and vicky are not the only ones relieved when aidan stumbles upon their picnic site there is a nasty consequence for aidan of his afternoons adventure however  he has run through hemlock and the pollen has burned him badly vicky finds him in the bedroom very ill indeed jenny is reassuring  she has seen hemlock burn before the old gypsy morgana will be able to mix a potion to counter the poison vicky approaches morganas caravan in great fear and trembling and certainly the wise womans reception of her is chilling she sends vicky running with both the antidote and a flea in her ear stumbling round the side of the caravan vicky sees to her horror a crude small gallows from which three clay figures dangle  standing behind her whispering in her ear morgana coaxes the girl to study the faces of the figures and as vicky watches they mix into those of sackville dulac and tredinnick  arthur lancelot and merlin these three are meddling in a past that does not belong to them  and no good will come of it the following day aidan is better but still not well enough to venture out of doors the girls go off on a sketching expedition and leave him to his own devices bored and disgruntled he returns to the hidden shrine  but discovers that the sword and anvil have vanished how can this be then terrifyingly the face of the king in the tapestry speaks to him he must not tamper with camelot it will destroy him if he disobeys aidan bolts badly frightened his dreams that night are full of menace and foreboding but the children are powerless to dissuade the three men from setting out on the final day of the dig indeed all three are hugely excited they have uncovered beyond the tessellation what appears to be a granite tombstone  and in its side engraved in latin are the words the once and future king could it be that the holy grail lies buried inside
