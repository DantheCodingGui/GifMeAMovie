\nHoney Daniels is a 22-year-old, sexy, tough-minded, part-black, part-Latina hip-hop dancer in New York\'s East Harlem who dreams of making it big as a music video choreographer. She teaches hip-hop dancing at a local youth center and encourages the local kids to attend to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. When luck shines on Honey in the form of a famous music video director, named Michael, who casts her in one music video, she\'s encouraged to make the transition from dancer to choreographer. But Honey\'s sudden success comes with a price when Michael refuses to take "no" for an answer to his sexual advances and then tries to sabotage her career by blackballing her out of the business.
