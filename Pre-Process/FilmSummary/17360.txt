matthew laments the fact that nothing changes in the trios routine though when he goes to work next day he finds everybody in a panic and about to quit as tax inspectors will discover carabines fraudulence lucy is off to fiji and asks matthew to go with her but when he rolls a dice tom obtained in shanghai 15 years earlier it tells him to stay as a result matthew takes the rap for the fraud and is imprisoned ben gets killed when his turnip gin explodes and tom fails to date the girl in flat 17 in an alternative scenario the dice persuades matthew to go to fiji where he and lucy run a bar tom marries the girl and bens turnip gin makes him a millionaire in fact neither of these happened as nothing ever changes and well into the future the trios circumstances are still exactly the same
