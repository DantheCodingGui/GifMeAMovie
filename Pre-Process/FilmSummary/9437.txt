in the post wwii days of american primetime television the depictions of men at home as being the stable breadwinner who could solve any problem that faced the family was borne out of a need for the american populace to feel safe the counterculture movement of the 1960s made those depictions seem outmoded and unrealistic the shows of norman lear qv most specifically all in the family 1968 broke open that mold where the men were shown as being independent thinkers often regardless of the needs of the family by the mid 1980s these two trends melded with the cosby show 1984 qv where cliff huxtable had a very specific point of view with regard to how to raise his often defiant children in the 1990s and beyond the postfeminist era made the man at home more undefined where he could be placed in almost any role from the selfabsorbed shlub such as ray barone or homer simpson to the selfdoubting family man such as michael steadman tony soprano or walter white and different forms of the family and their associated issues are also now shown from modern family 2009 qv to big love 2006 qv to the bernie mac show 2001 qv
