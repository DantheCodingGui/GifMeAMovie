on a lonely australian headland one of our oldest lighthouses has been dying for 18 years while its beam has provided hope and safety to shipping traffic for over 130 years time has not been so kind in return with modern technology bustard head lighthouse like the others around the world has been mainly demanned low maintenance lamps solar power and computers keep the lights burning and turning these days but the plight of the historic landmark on bustard head named exactly 234 years ago on may 24 by captain james cook would have been tragic if not for the crusade of passionate former lighthouse keepers stuart and shirley buchanan bustard head lighthouse station has been the scene of repeated tragedy throughout its history  certainly more than any other lighthouse in australia death by murder accident illness and suicide has plagued many of its keepers who suffered the hardship of isolation the lighthouse life imposed stuart and shirley buchanan fell in love with the beautiful bustard head location when they were lighthouse keepers there in 70s they believed they had found their paradise but when they learned the abandoned station cottages had been severely vandalised in the 90s and state government parks and wildlife service wanted to bulldoze the site they were livid after the anger subsided the determination set in to save and restore the station but their pleas to state government for help fell on deaf ears and obstacles seemed to block their path at every turn then they received a 140000 commonwealth heritage grant and their dream to revive their beloved bustard head took shape but not before a long hard and costly journey that tried their nerves and their resolve on many occasions
