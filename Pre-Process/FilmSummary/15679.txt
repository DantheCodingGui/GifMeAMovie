amateur musicologist charles smith stumbled upon references to an unknown composer who in the early 1920s provided inspiration to the great australian artist norman lindsay surprised hed never heard of this composer and very curious smith set off on an archaeological dig and his find has turned the music world into a frenzy for more than 20 years smith has had a consuming interest in norman lindsay  as much for his philosophical ideas as for his art he was fossicking in an antiquarian bookshop one day searching for literature on lindsay and came across a gigantic book of norman lindsay letters included in the book were several extremely affectionate letters to adolphe beutler who judging from the letters was obviously a composer whose music at one stage was a source of great inspiration for lindsays work smith was tantalised and went off to find him searching in all the usual places an academic researcher would look  but to no avail beutler who along with lindsay had been part of a very vibrant arts community in the 1920s had simply vanished from view along with his music keen to solve the mystery smith eventually resorted to the white pages in the first phone call he struck gold he found beutlers 82 year old son fred who just happened to have in his possession his fathers entire life works  piano music songs string quartets a symphony and even an opera it seems charles discovery and the large scale and rarity of the works may have unearthed a very important long forgotten chapter in australian music history
