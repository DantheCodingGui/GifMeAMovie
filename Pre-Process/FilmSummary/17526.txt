its the finals of the world beyblading championships and the final battle pits kai against the defending world champion tyson the fight is incredibly intense and whats even more amazing it looks like the two combatants are so evenly matched there might not be a winner and thats exactly what happens at the end of the battle kai and tyson drop out at the exact same time now a dilemma arises mr dickenson has to make the final decision and hes leaning toward calling it a tie because hes afraid that if they continue the battle someone could get hurt but kai steps up to the plate and pleads his case for the battle to continue which it does as the fight resumes the intensity is felt throughout the arena again they are evenly matched and it looks like no one will take it when they both mount a final assault its huge in the end tyson comes out on top and daichi and tyson become the new beyblade tag team world champions
