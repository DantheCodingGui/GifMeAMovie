in february of 1909 the indomitable chiricahua apache warrior and war shaman geronimo lay on his deathbed he summoned his nephew to his side whispering i should never have surrendered i should have fought until i was the last man alive it was an admission of regret from a man whose insistent pursuit of military resistance in the face of overwhelming odds confounded not only his mexican and american enemies but many of his fellow apaches as well born around 1820 geronimo grew into a leading warrior and healer but after his tribe was relocated to an arizona reservation in 1872 he became a focus of the fury of terrified white settlers and of the growing tensions that divided apaches struggling to survive under almost unendurable pressures to angry whites geronimo became the archfiend perpetrator of unspeakable savage cruelties to his supporters he remained the embodiment of proud resistance the upholder of the old chiricahua ways to other apaches especially those who had come to see the white mans path as the only viable road geronimo was a stubborn troublemaker unbalanced by his unquenchable thirst for vengeance whose actions needlessly brought the enemys wrath down on his own people at a time when surrender to the reservation and acceptance of the white mans civilization seemed to be the indians only realistic options geronimo and his tiny band of chiricahuas fought on the final holdouts they became the last native american fighting force to capitulate formally to the government of the united states
