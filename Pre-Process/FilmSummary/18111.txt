before we relaunch barinia narelle visits the fish and street markets where youll meet the delightful giovanna she has been peeling artichokes for 70 years weve also been invited back to the fishermans lair for a feast followed by a visit to sottomarina with manuel and his children we revisit the boatyard and launch barinia into the water ready to start the season and before we sail to venice we join narelle in the galley where she prepares branzino al sale using all the fresh produce she bought at the markets
