archie fears for joeys mortal soul because he hasnt been baptized and mike and gloria dont want to put religion into his life so archie gets the idea that while he is baptizing that he will sneak down to the church and have it done before he gets back edith is completely against it locking archies hat and coat in the closet and refusing to give up the key while her back is turned he grabs a hat and sweater out of the box that is going to the poor grabs joey out of his pram and runs to the church the minister refuses to perform the baptism without the parents consent so archie sneaks into the sanctuary and does it himself
