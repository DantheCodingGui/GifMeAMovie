kevin is reluctant to introduce his artist girlfriend julie to his uptight and judgmental parents but she takes that the wrong way and decides theyre not meant to be together he goes walking in the woods alone and is thirsty enough to drink water falling from the pot of a statue of a woman he feels sick afterward and julie and their friends dont see him return the next day a strange professor approaches julie and claims he knows where kevin is then leads her to a stone statue that looks like him claiming kevin turned into it julie doesnt believe it at first but then meets the statues creator vivian white it turns out that the statue was based on a greek myth about a starcrossed couple who chose to turn to stone and always be together and there was never water in the bucket that the statue had been holding before they learn that the statue has been divided in half with a male subject detached from it so the woman probably released water like tears and transformed kevin the only problem is they have to get a hold of the other half of the statue to turn him back
