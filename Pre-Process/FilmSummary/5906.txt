before adam12s shift malloy is confronted by carl owens a former boxer who has just been released from prison after serving time for killing someone in a bar brawl malloy was one of the arresting officers at the time of the conviction owens threatened revenge on malloy whenever his release this confrontation hangs over adam12 for the better part of their shift reed who seems more concerned for malloys safety their first call is an unknown residential noise issue where the woman caller heard noise in her neighbors garage for the better part of the night which then stopped when malloy and reed investigate inside the garage they deal with two issues the immediate one which ends up being more important as it is a matter of life or death next as they patrol they check out a liquor store with some seemingly unusual activity inside then on the way to their code 7 they get a flat its not needing to change the flat that bothers them but rather having to deal with their onlooker following their eventual code 7 they attend to a call of a missing four year old child from an apartment building and later on patrol they track a vehicle where they spotted the driver conveniently dispose of some cargo  a bag of drugs  once he spotted the patrol vehicle by the end of the shift malloy has a better idea if owens is planning on carrying out his threat and reed has a better idea of how malloy felt when owens first threatened him
