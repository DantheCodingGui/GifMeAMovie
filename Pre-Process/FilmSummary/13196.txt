every year the department store has an elaborate celebration for the birthday now the 90th of mr grace the owner after a brainstorming for a pleasing original present without any cost the first floor decides on a welsh song in miners costume as the grace family comes from wales after various hiccups who will sing what with our without organ and in what key they get it right however then mr rumbolds brother mycroft who works for the college of arms and was asked to research the grace genealogy to devise a coat of arms reports the family actually migrated from scotland where they were called grouse so the program is changed to a highland fling and a sword dance by mr humphries further research traces back to somerset as grice so that gets another song ultimately a rather surprising set of oldest roots is performed on the big day
