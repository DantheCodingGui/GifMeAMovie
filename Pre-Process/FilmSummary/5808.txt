a pair of motorcyclists snatch handbags and go offroad down trails where police officers cannot follow in their patrol cars a motorcycle club in the area is suspected but never caught reed invites them to a community meeting to air their complaints on their continued harassment when they attend their leader challenges malloy to a duel and they settle on a dirt bike race reed must teach malloy how to race on a dirt course malloy loses the race but seems to gain some respect from the leader of the club on patrol reed spots a suspicious license plate and traces it to a hot car when another purse snatching occurs the pursuit ends at the dirt trails however this time the motorcycle club is on the other end of the trail and forces the thieves back to malloy and reed where they surrender they are not part of the club a biker gang called kings choppers are at odds with the police its leader skinner seems to have it in especially for malloy it doesnt help that there have been a rash of purse snatches against elderly women the two perpetrators always on motorcycles and who always manage to get away to areas where police cruisers cant access the gang who does cause problems by riding recklessly on the streets believe they are seen as the prime suspects but dont really seem to care about the purse snatch victims or anyone they see in establishment of society they also believe that the community outreach meetings malloy has been facilitating on behalf of the department are venues for establishment to implicate them for all societys problems or at least the purse snatches as such reed invites the bikers to attend a meeting to show them otherwise skinner is even more skeptical after having attended a meeting he who wants to show up malloy once and for all in whatever means possible the more deadly the better malloy figures he in turn needs to show skinner and his gang what hes all about both as a cop and as a human but within the bounds of the law the two finally agree to a motocross race despite malloy never having done such riding seriously but malloy thinks he knows of a good teacher who will get him prepared in time for the race regardless of if he wins or loses malloy hopes that the process will show skinner that the cops are not the bad guys and that perhaps the purse snatchers are for giving bikers in general a bad name
