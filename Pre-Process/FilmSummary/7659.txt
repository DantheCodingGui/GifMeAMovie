lyle endicott is a smooth manipulator but hes not smooth enough to save his job at a manhattan art museum and his talent doesnt seem to have gotten him anywhere in life why not just once can something go right for me he wonders luck finally seems to shine on him when he overhears his boss mr koether talking to one of the museums patrons martha cheney an invalid who uses a wheelchair she and koether call each other by their first names but their friendship isnt enough to persuade miss cheney to sell him the famous cheney vase lyle realizes the heirloom is worth a lot of money  money that can be his if he manages to insinuate himself into the old womans life lyle endicott is summarily dismissed from his position as assistant curator at a local museum there is little love lost between him and his boss herbert koether so lyle sets his sights on acquiring the cheney vase a piece that seemingly any museum curator would be thrilled to obtain endicott knows the vases owner martha cheney and using a forged letter of recommendation gets a job as her assistant soon endicott is running her entire household and the elderly martha is a virtual prisoner in her own home there is only one thing she can do to keep the vase out of endicotts hands when lyle endicott is fired from his job at an art museum he has his girlfriend pamela type a phony letter of recommendation for him he takes the letter to the invalid martha cheney whom he met at the museum lyle knows that the museum has been eagerly trying to buy a valuable vase that miss cheney received from her father while working for her lyle sets out to isolate her from everyone else so that he can take advantage of the situation for himself
