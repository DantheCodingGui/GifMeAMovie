steve roach leads a small breakaway union called the shearers and rural workers union with a membership made up mostly of shearers and miners disillusioned with the giant awu he says he makes only a lousy two hundred dollars a week from a job that takes up practically every waking moment and keeps him away from home in melbourne at least half the year while hes on the road in his battered old car staying in the backrooms of pubs for ten dollars a night his wife debbie is earning the money to keep their two young children fed and clothed debbie says i would say hes probably born 100 years too late  working for something you believe in for nothing is just not something many people do which is charity work which is basically what it is to him if the waterside workers are seen by many as an over protected and privileged elite the people steve roach represents are in the mould of the traditional battler we follow him as he travels to cobar in outback new south wales to organise a convoy of miners whove just lost their job and all their entitlements because of a sudden mine closure and we also join him on the mua picket line in melbourne through his story the threads connecting the past and the present are starkly highlighted plus wallys weddings wally richards came into this world marching to the sound of a different drum a local maryborough identity wally stood at 6ft 4inches was illiterate and due to his physical deformities spoke with difficulty yet the beat that wally heard all his life was soft and gentle and didnt include things like envy greed or hate wally liked to go to weddings anyones wedding and over 40 years he amassed a collection of nearly 20 000 photographs from the weddings he attended in the maryborough district it was only after his death last year that his extraordinary pictures came to light but fortunately his family with the help of the entire town of maryborough painstakingly catalogued all the photos and recently staged an exhibition
