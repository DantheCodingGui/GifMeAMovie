when dr rodney syme was unable to alleviate the unbearable pain suffered by a cancer patient many years ago it triggered what he calls his epiphany i could hear her screaming as i entered the foyer of the hospital he says and there was nothing we could do to relieve her agony that had the most profound effect on me for more than two decades dr syme has campaigned to legalise voluntary euthanasia for the terminally ill he also continues to counsel and help people like former corporate boss bernard who has tongue and lung cancer and has recently planned his own funeral and hosted his own living wake its an issue that polarises the medical community i think in the euthanasia debate everyones searching for a line beyond which we can all agree that someones life is not worth living and i think that line is always arbitrary and its not a line its a cliff says physician dr karen hitchcock but at 80 years of age dr syme believes time is running out to achieve his goal of changing the law and hes decided to risk all even if it means going to prison
