obnoxious lord willoughby makes a riskeverything bet with sir gawain that he wont be able to find a gummi bear cavin cant break his promise and show him gummi glen to help so begs the gummi bears to step in and help him themselves but theres an added reason for urgency tummi has eaten fruit off a tree that causes anyone to do so to turn into a tree himself and a spell is needed to save him but the gummi medallion has fallen off of zummis neck while getting him inside and willoughby has found it and is set on hiding it so gawain cant be proved right the gummies ask gawain to team up with them to reclaim it
