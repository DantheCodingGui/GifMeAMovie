the officers experience radio problems delaying their deployment and causing mac to reprimand them lately this has become a issue between him and all the officers a call at a store being robbed has a woman taken hostage and to the roof the officers are held off with gunfire but when they move to a different roof the hostage is left behind when she doesnt complete a jump between roofs the officers rescue her and with the aid of air 10 track the suspects and capture them at the station mac talks to pete about a conversation with his wife she has opened an antique shop and it is taking her time which mac does not like putting a strain on their marriage a call about a runaway elderly woman has her husband mad because his wife goes to a pizza restaurant to listen to a piano player there mac arrives at the restaurant to ask pete to pick up his kids and overhears an orderly who arrives he states the couple has been married for sixty years but the husband cant understand his wife desire for private time occasionally forcing mac to understand the problem with his wife mac sniping at malloy and reed for a situation not of their doing is the latest indication that something is bothering mac adam12s first call takes them to a supermarket where two armed robbers stormed the premises just before opening they have since taken the head cashier jody hostage the three which are on the roof of the building although the on the ground officers get assistance from air patrol mac calls in the swat team the problem is is that their eta is twenty minutes twenty minutes which jody may not have thus malloy and reed have to try and find a way onto the roof to help her later while filling out the police report malloy overhears mac talking on the telephone and learns what is bothering him mac ends up confiding in malloy but its adam12s next call  that of an elderly couple living in a care home the husband who doesnt like when his wheelchairbound wife heads off on her own  to which mac also attends that mac may get a better perspective of whats going on in his own life
