abraham and isaac is an emotionfilled story of complete obedience and unreserved sacrifice this heartrending story is one of the greatest tests of obedience faith and trust in god found anywhere in the bible abraham passes the test and renews gods promise that he will become the father of many nations abraham keeps faith in god and exhibits extraordinary courage in following gods will that faith and courage remain strong even when abraham is tested to the limit when god sees the power of abrahams faith he rewards abraham with unlimited blessings the lord has promised abram and sarai that they would have children as countless as the stars yet they are growing old so sarai tells abram to take her servant hagar as a wife perhaps she will bear a son ishmael is born to hagar but ishmael is not the son promised by god the lord appears to abrams and renews his promise as a symbol of this covenant god renames abram and sarai henceforth they are known as abraham and sarah miraculously sarah gives birth to isaac gad tells abraham that he should care for ishmaelbut my promise and my inheritance shall go to isaac as a dutiful son isaac helps his father with ritual sacrifices do you know why we sacrifice our finest lamb abraham asks him because god has given us everything the boy replies we must give him our best the answer pleases his father promise me isaac says abraham that you will always do what the lord asks isaac confirms that he will the lord appears to abraham and tells him that he must sacrifice isaac shaken but obedient to god abraham prepares to kill isaac isaac lies down on the altar of ritual sacrifice willing to give up his life to god suddenly the lord speaks to abraham lay not thy hand upon the lad abraham because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son i will multiply thy seed like the stars in heaven and by thy seed thou shalt be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice
