while on patrol in a residential area the officers suddenly take fire from reeds side of the car at night reed fires at the person he believes is firing at them after he sees gun flashes and a gun barrel after the shooting he and malloy are taken to the station where the shooting board grills both of them but especially the rookie reed about the events that took place they want to make sure all concerns and issues are covered but to reed it feels like an inquisition at the end he is told the shooting appears to be justified but not before his confidence is shaken as malloy and reed patrol through a residential neighborhood near the end of their current shift a bullet careens through their front windshield malloy quickly hits the brakes and pulls over as the two of them take a defensive position behind their vehicle doors as another bullet is shot from the snipers in their direction reed who sees some movement in the darkness near a house fires back one of those shots which ends up killing who they believe to be the only sniper as the evening progresses from the shooting site back to the police station reed on the surface seems composed and unaffected but malloy who is getting to know his partner is certain that this shooting is mentally eating at reed especially as they find out who the sniper was sgt jerry miller is the lead internal investigator who has to ask pointed questions of malloy and reed to ascertain the entire nature of the incident despite the sergeants statement to the contrary reed feeling the pressure sees many of the questions as being accusatory which he has to learn may be to his benefit if only to ensure that his actions were by the book and the shots fired justified
