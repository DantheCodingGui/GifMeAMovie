malloy and reed have a monotonous day interrupted by two rambunctious female felonious joyriders an exceptionally bright young boy with a photographic memory named harold that clues them into a home burglary ring disguised as movers respond to two paintsniffing country bumpkins shooting rifles at a suspended box of dynamite and check out a beauty school client who lodges a potentially explosive complaint while at the station malloy and reed decide to check in on harold to discover he doesnt see the burglars mugshot in the books when they give harold a ride home harold spots the burglar malloy and reed make a successful albeit bullet riddled arrest and solve the crime while proving harolds brilliance to the police departments doubting detectives the lull in adam12s day is broken when all units are requested to assist in the pursuit of a vehicle occupied by two females who have broken several traffic violations when they eventually stop the vehicle malloy and reed find that there are a few more charges they can level against the two they next are called to a report of a suspected residential burglary reed but particularly malloy find that the eyewitness harold ruskin may be the most accurate comprehensive and thus reliable witness with who theyve ever dealt despite his tender age sergeant sam poster who eventually acts as the lead investigator isnt as sure as malloy of harolds usefulness only if they are able to catch the burglars will either poster or malloy be proven correct their next call is to shots fired from an unknown source upon investigating they find the stupid and potentially dangerous things people will do when theyre high however innocent those actions may seem they are then called to a beauty school where the instructor owner received a bomb threat she is pretty sure who threatened her and why they just have to find if there really is a bomb and get a confession from the suspected perpetrator
