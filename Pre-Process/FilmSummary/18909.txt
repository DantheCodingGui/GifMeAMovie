everyone is having to come to terms with the death of starbuck the admiral reviews her file in tears and sam anders gets drunk but apollo cant quite bring himself to place her photo on the wall of dead crewmen as he had promised preparations are being finalized for gaius baltars trial and admiral adama is one of 5 people selected at random to serve on the tribunal as tom zarek had predicted however there is violence with baltars attorney is killed his new attorney is romo lampkin and its only by chance that chief tyrol uncovers a bomb meant to kill the lawyer the admiral puts his son lee in charge of lampkins security but the two dont exactly see eye to eye on what that means for lee it means ensuring that the disgraced expresident gets a fair trial and his revived interest in the law leads him to become more involved president roslin has a dream where she is chasing hera in the former opera house on kobol athena and caprica six are there with her col tigh and sam anders hear a tune while sitting in joes bar but they seem the only ones who can hear it later presidential assistant tory foster hears the same tune gaius baltars trial is about to begin and he has to deal with a cult following who he considers to be a bunch of crazies at his trial the prosecutor points out that 5197 people died or disappeared on new caprica col tigh doesnt exactly help the prosecution when he appears drunk on the stand and eventually admits that he would do and say anything to see baltar found guilty lee proves to be an effective member of the defense team scoring points in his crossexamination of president roslin it comes as a high personal cost however
