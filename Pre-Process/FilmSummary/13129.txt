wiley doesnt have as much luck trying out for the school hockey team as zach does then he runs into a mysterious figure in the lockerroom basement who says that wiley reminds him of a player who didnt start off well either but soon improved amazingly when he got a certain hockeystick jake the snake desmond he tells wiley where to find the stick which still has the title snake on it wiley does do excellently with it  he makes it into the last opening on the team instead of zach but doesnt act like he cares about his friend zach soon notices that wileys flesh begins peeling heavily and he grows distant from him saying hes better than jake the snake so is the greatest hockeyplayer himself he even seems to be tempted to eat mice zach follows wiley to where he got the stick and meets the character  jake desmond now a man in snakes form who tells zach that every time wiley uses the stick he will continue the process of transforming into a snake like all the players who used the stick after he did zach knows he must save his friend but the only problem is he doesnt know how to stop wiley from playing
