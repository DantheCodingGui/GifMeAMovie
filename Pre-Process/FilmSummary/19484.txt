when a meteorite lands in the flat nev and crazy keith have fun at mr pranks expense by pretending to be aliens and getting him to wait on them he soon sees through them but when a real alien comes out of the meteorite he assumes this too is a hoaxer until it ties him up to experiment on him crazy keith stalls the alien by pretending to be an intergalactic parking policeman whilst nev has to work out how to turn off the aliens machine and send the meteorite back into space
