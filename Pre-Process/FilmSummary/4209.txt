after picking the letter p chef lauren gulyas must combine pork and pears together in a mouthwatering dish but first she tries them out separately lauren starts by making prosciuttowrapped pork with chorizo she uses a tenderloin which is the leanest cut of all the tenderloin cooks in no time but because its so lean it really cries out for some spice and flavour thats where the spicy salty spanish pork chorizo comes in next on the menu is pears and she uses them in a pear and parm pasta called fiocchetti then its time to take on the challenge of combining the two and just wait until you see what she does
