being the new girl is often rather frightening even at a conventional school so for rosa martinelli 13 to have been accepted into the school of the performing arts is something of a mixed blessing it came at a topsyturvy time in her life anyway her father nick and mother brigid have just separated and brigid and rosa are trying to figure out their new life on their own rosas pleased to have delighted brigid so much in taking the first step toward the dream of stardom  but is it brigids dream or rosas own although rosas voice is pleasant it is nothing extraordinary and being naturally shy she doesnt enjoy the audition for her first school production pretty and spiteful lucy  who is far more confident both in her talent and her social life than rosa  doesnt empathize shes delighted to have a new victim for her teasing and the interest brad  school hunk and erstwhile boyfriend of lucy  takes in rosa doesnt endear the new girl to her any further lucy gets the main part rosa takes a place in the chorus  but even this poses its problems the actors must find their own costumes and how can brigid afford to buy rosa a new dress rosas eye is caught by a beautiful forties dress in the window of the local op shop it fits her perfectly  as if it were made for her but the dress was originally made for julia  fascinating and charming julia was poised on the brink of stardom when she was tragically killed and julia plans to make the comeback of all time  from the grave at first julias presence in rosas life seems benign  exciting certainly with julia taking over rosas voice rosa stuns mrs monmouth her music teacher with her overnight transformation into a student of extraordinary talent but its too late to recast the main part  until lucy suffers an unfortunate accident she insists a girl she has never seen before pushed her down the stairs  and rosa becomes faintly uneasy about her ghostly new friend rosajulia does the show to great acclaim  but at the end of the night julia refuses to leave rosas body shes out for a complete takeover and when rosa returns to consciousness she discovers she is trapped  trapped in the green dress luckless lucy spots the dress hanging back in the window of the op shop intrigued she tries it on  and discovers rosa wearing the green dress lucy confronts julia  with rosa speaking through her but lucy has an ulterior motive come to me julia  leave secondhand rosas body behind with my looks and your talent how can we fail despite rosas frantic warning lucy invites julia into her soul  and is trapped herself  trapped in the green dress as for rosa she has realized there are many things she is no longer interested in giving up in pursuit of fame and fortune her dreams are her own
