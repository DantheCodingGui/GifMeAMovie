its all about the heat and the sweet as chef leah wildman works with two very different h ingredients  honey and habanero she starts with a delicious lavender honey rack of lamb where the sweetness of the honey offsets the richness of the lamb perfectly the trick to making killer lamb every time is to season it well and sear it in a pan before finishing in the oven next she prepares habanero poppers with blue cheese dip she combines bacon cream cheese and fresh lime juice for the filling which has the perfect balance of textures flavours and heat finally leah faces the exciting challenge of combining the two ingredients in a dish that showcases both heat and sweet
