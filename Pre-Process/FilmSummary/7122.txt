while the sultan and genie prepare a banquet for another pompous princely suitor for princess jasmine who wont hear of another then aladdin anyway shes amazed to see him save a rat from the princes hands when her commoner lover replies he has lots in common with a real street rat she takes iago along for an incognito taste of street life soon dared to prove herself as a thief a blind merchant enchants the mirror she stole so it transforms them into the first thing iago unknowingly says they could be she a rat he a green lizard surviving without starving thus not only proves a good lesson about the life of agrabas poor its quit an adventurous challenge to get to and into the palace alive and past her pet tiger rajah who hates rats like everybody else but is naturally equipped as a deadly vermin hunter
