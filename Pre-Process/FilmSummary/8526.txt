mike and gloria have been going to a class that teaches them how to fight constructively and their newfound knowledge opens their eyes as to what a doormat edith is to archie they convince her that she has to stand up to archie and bring their arguments to an equal balance edith is reluctant at first but when archie comes home everyone is shocked by how stubborn edith can be when she puts her foot down she and archie get into a serious argument the lynchpin of which is the upcoming visit by her cousin whom archie cant stand archie says no but edith sticks to her guns and refuses to back down she ends up sleeping on the couch as a result and a confused and shellshocked archie tries to make amends when the subject of ediths cousin comes up again archie begins the argument over again and still edith wont back down
