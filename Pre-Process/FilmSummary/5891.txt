the shift starts with the officers pulling over a vehicle for a traffic violation when reed spots one of the men pulling a gun they arrest them after learning the car is stolen they find the body of a young woman which the men planned to dump in the ocean in the trunk of the car the girl had stolen the car and the men who escaped from a mental institution killed her for seven dollars and the car later the officers are called to a home where a teenage girls friends accidentally break a small window while toilet papering the house the girl tells the officers the boys are planning to return but she refuses to name them the officers roll by the house as the boys are in a fight with the father resulting in him being seriously stabbed what starts out as malloy and reed pulling a car over on a routine traffic violation quickly turns sour as the male in the passenger seat pulls a gun intending to use it on malloy as he questions the male driver the passenger did not see reed on the passenger side of the car reed who saw the man pull the gun the two men end up not talking but as they are questioned down at the station they seem like they intend to protect their own self at the expense of the other the key to what they are hiding seems to be what is locked in the cars trunk for which they have no key in another traffic incident malloy and reed pull over a man who cut them off wary from the previous gun incident malloy and reed take proper precautions when the man reaches for his jacket upon their approach although the drivers move in this case ends up being innocent he is unapologetic for the grief he caused malloy and reed also attend to a case of a house being toilet papered with a window being broken in the process the perpetrators as seen by a neighbor witness who was the one who called the police were friends of the homeowners provocative sixteen year old daughter vickie herman vickie later tells the officers that her father widowed john herman treats her and her friends like little innocents while they themselves are not as innocent as he believes vickie wants them to keep an eye out on the house as she believes one of her friends may retaliate against her father under their belief that he called the cops against them malloy and reed can only patrol and hope that vickies assumption is not true
