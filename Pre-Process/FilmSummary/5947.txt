malloy returns from a sunday off with woods fishing a call at the start of patrol is about an elderly lady with poor memory who frequents a store but says her poltergeist is the one who creates accidents the owner knows her but cannot reach her daughter to pick her up and pay for damages the officers take her in but her poltergeist spills a large bottle of perfume in the back seat of the squad car they must put up with the smell for the entire shift despite numerous trips to the garage to see tony the mechanic while on patrol they notice a woman who cant speak trying to ask for help she writes that a man entered the church via a window and they spot a man emptying the safe officer jerry woods is the backup and identifies the man as the pastor who forgot his id and keys the pastor is glad to see gerard and says they have missed him on sundays gerard states he had to work sundays and malloy backs him up saying they were in the same boat yesterday a kidnapping call turns out to be a man picking up the daughter of a neighbor who is a drunk to take her to her grandmother a young boy flags them down to report a big boy stole his bike and his friends are chasing him they patrol the neighborhood until they spot the person being held down by the young boys friends a relative cold snap is going through los angeles which makes the work environment difficult for adam12 after the first call of the shift it is to a retail store where an issue arises between the store owner and one of his long time customers the elderly woman customer who suffers from dementia she often breaks things in the store she blaming it on the poltergeist that follows her the store owner is always able to get the womans daughter to come and pick up her mother and pay for the damage the daughter who he cannot contact this time while malloy and reed drive the elderly woman to the station her poltergeist breaks a cheap bottle of perfume on the back seat of the cruiser they ask tony the police mechanic to try and deal with the smell tony an extaxi mechanic believes he can get any smell out but tonys attempts may be too little too late and lower priority compared to that facing mac while on patrol they spot a frantic young woman on the street it turns out that she is deaf and was trying to tell someone that she saw a man climb through the church window probably to rob it beyond what they find inside the church which places woods in a slightly uncomfortable situation malloy and reed also have to deal with someone outside whose olfactory senses are keener than most next they are alerted to a child kidnapping case where the perpetrators vehicle was identified when they spot the vehicle near the childs home they learn he true nature of the kidnapping again on patrol they are flagged down by a young boy whose bike was stolen he may weigh the value of his bike compared to riding around the in smelly cruiser in an attempt to get it back but at the end of their shift the smell in the car ends up being the next units problem
