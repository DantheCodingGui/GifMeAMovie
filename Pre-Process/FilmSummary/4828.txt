a young poor boy comes across a leprechaun and rescues him he is granted 3 wishes he wastes the first two so really ponders the third one and eventually wishes for all the money in the world we see money flying from all over the world into a gigantic stack the boy goes and gets his friends to show off the money they ask for some he tries to give it to them but it just flies right back into the stack his friends get mad at him thinking he is being greedy the president comes and tries to tell the boy that he must give the money back he then tries to take it by force but to no avail the leprechaun is present telling everyone to give it up the money stays with the boy the president then tries to circumvent the wish by handing out monopoly money and calling it real the monopoly money then flies into the stack as well the leprechaun explains that it doesnt matter if they change what money is all money is the boys the boy is finally able to reverse the wish by rescuing the leprechaun again this grants him one and only one wish this time but at the expense of never seeing his friend the leprechaun again
