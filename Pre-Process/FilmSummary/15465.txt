australian story continues the story of a group of vietnam veterans who set out to find and retrieve the bodies of six fallen comrades abandoned beyond enemy lines nearly 40 years ago they call themselves operation aussies home and last week we saw them finally recover the remains of two men richard parker and peter gillson  and provide closure for the families of the dead men but with more comrades still to find they encountered unexpected resistance over the case of a soldier called john gillespie his family wanted nothing to do with operation aussies home searching for remains meant digging up bad memories of 1971 when gillespie died in a medivac helicopter crash in the long hai mountains not far from saigon gillespies sister christine had been fervently opposed to the australian involvement in the vietnam war and time had done nothing to quell her anger for the diggers this rejection was nothing short of devastating it forced some to question the whole reasoning behind what they had spent five years and a lot of their own money doing for leader jim bourke it looked like the end to operation aussies home and then a turnaround we follow gillespies sister on a most extraordinary journey to the site where her brother died and we witness the coming together of ideological foes both christine gillespie and jim bourke emerge vastly changed by the experience in a country that continues to confound all who visit it
