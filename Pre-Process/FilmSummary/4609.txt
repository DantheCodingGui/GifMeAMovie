take a trip to saturn the planetary pinup boy and not only do you get a ringside seat to the greatest spectacle in the solar system but a close encounter with two extraordinary moons tiny enceladus is making all the headlines as the mustsee moon these days its the little moon that has it all enormous geysers of water and ice shooting into space from the south pole point to a warm salty ocean beneath the surface and perhaps a real possibility of life even more earthlike and yet far more alien is titan with a thick atmosphere and weather potentially an easier surface to explore even than mars this is the only other world we know that you could visit without a spacesuit rug up for the cold and fly a hot air balloon in titanian skies trek across vast dune fields or row across a titanian lake just dont fall in or get caught in the rain its liquid natural gas out here not water and itll freeze you as hard as rock
