australian story concludes the story on the shaping of serial killer ivan milat and the cracks opening up in his family milat was jailed for life eight years ago for the murder of seven backpackers whose bodies were found in the belanglo state forest outside sydney many questions remain unanswered and there is uncertainty about the full extent of ivan milats crimes last week one of his siblings broke the bonds of rigid family loyalty to speak out against the convicted killer he said it was likely there were more of his brothers victims still undiscovered he claims the milat family is damaged by its denial of ivans guilt and as a result he says he has received death threats from some of his own siblings ivan milat is held in goulbourn jail corrective services policy requires strict monitoring of the phone calls of maximum security prisoners nevertheless we hear from ivan milat tonight with ivan milats permission his sisterinlaw caroline recorded a series of phone conversations with him on one occasion ivan milat also rang the abc and spoke to a journalist in the program ivan milat states that he was totally amazed when his defence lawyer in the trial tried to suggest that one of his brothers richard or walter could have been responsible for the backpacker murders milat said he never argued that in the first place ivan milats lawyer andrew boe issued the following statement in reply i have yet to be involved in a criminal trial where an assertion of fact was put to the court or jury without specific instructions from a client to do so and the milat trial was no exception the apparent suggestion that we did so in this case is a calculated falsehood it is however not appropriate for us to publish mr milats instructions on this or any other issue at this stage
