we typically receive the schedule from production 34 weeks in advance once we have it confirmed that a taping is happening it goes up on our site this is obviously not an exact estimate since each shows scheduling is different if youre dying to see a particular show on a particular date then we recommend checking the 1iota site frequently to see when it gets posted following our facebook and twitter accounts can help as we occasionally announce when shows are going up we never recommend making travel plans based solely on free tickets
