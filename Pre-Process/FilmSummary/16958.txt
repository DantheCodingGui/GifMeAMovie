baby jake is in the orchard on this windy adventure leaves are swirling around him as one leaf swirls and then falls to the ground it lands on its stalk the leaf is standing on one leg baby jake also stands on one leg and it looks like he is in a ballet position when the leaf leaps into the air baby jake does so too and before long he is leaping like a ballet dancer suddenly the wind blows a sock past baby jake baby jake and nibbles the rabbit dance along following the sock until they reach a washing line of clothes all dancing as they dry in the orchard breeze the sock joins all the other socks for a ballet performance baby jake has an idea raising his hands just like a musical conductor ballet music plays and baby jake together with nibbles and the clothes perform a funny ballet dance together
