on a lazy sunday morning gloria gets fired up about womens liberation in particular the way that she thinks that archie treats edith like his personal slave she gets no help from the usually liberal mike who believes that men and women are total equals but only when women are willing to admit their inferiority to men a heated argument ensues that leaves gloria storming out the front door the next day she comes back to gather some of her things and he lets her know that without her there is no joy in his life another fight breaks out only this time it leads to makeup sex and all is bliss
