ally is turning 28 that is upsetting enough to her but elaine wants to throw a party at the bar for her and greg wont sleep with her and she doesnt know why shes defending a man in court who was arrested for breaking into his dates house and massaging her feet she tries to fix things for the couple at the bar but its not a good night for ally especially when renee chooses to surprise her as well and it looks like its not going to be a happy birthday after all
