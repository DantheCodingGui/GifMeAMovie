in the early days of television american prime time provided an idealized and stereotypical view of the american woman who was more often than not portrayed as being subservient to the man basically as housewife and mother in service to the family in real life most american women could could not measure up to this idealized view from 1950 to 1970 three lead characters are seen as groundbreaking away from this stereotype despite two being wife and mother lucy ricardo in i love lucy 1951 qv laura petrie in the dick van dyke show 1961 qv and mary richards in mary tyler moore 1970 qv who were each independent for different reasons much of those reasons specific to the era other characterizations of independent women that followed owed much to these three and were reflective of the times they include roseanne connor in roseanne 1988 qv and the title character in murphy brown 1988 qv the lack of advertising on cable opened up the role of the independent woman even more with sex and the city 1998 qv being one of the earliest successes current examples of american prime time shows that feature independent women include desperate housewives 2004 qv weeds 2005 qv greys anatomy 2005 qv nurse jackie 2009 qv and the good wife 2009 qv similarities between the women portrayed in these shows are that they are far from perfect but they are true to most parts of their selves
