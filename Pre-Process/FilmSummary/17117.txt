antonio gates was a great basketball player he balled against the best in the game in high school and more than held his own he was simply put  a true banger he played a little football on the side but his true love was on the hardwood but while his peers made it to the nba  antonio would not be drafted into the nba with nothing left to do and in need of a paycheck antonio decided to at least try to play football  lets just say it all worked out today antonio is a record breaking allpro tight end for the san diego chargers and is considered one of the best in the nfl but of course all people want to talk about today  is what a great basketball player he was back n the day
