scott wolter does not believe in bigfootbut he sure hears about it a lot thats because the earliest bigfoot sightings were supposedly recorded inguess what rocks bigfoot sightings are pervasive along the west coast but lately reports of the big beast have started popping up in minnesotahis home stateand he heads to investigate entering into the investigation as a skepticwhich is not a role we often see scott inhe decides to tackle the question of whether bigfoot is real he goes in search of proof checking out rock paintings of bigfoot in california and even traveling to nepal where he meets with a sherpa who tells him hes seen the yeti an asiatic cousin of bigfoot that still roams the himalayas with his own eyes so in the end will scott become a believer
