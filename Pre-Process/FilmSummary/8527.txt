the day has come that mike and gloria are moving into their new home and archie is practically pushing them out the door archie is being so obnoxious that mike finally reaches a boiling point until he declares his independence and calls archie a fathead he and gloria spend the night in their new home without electricity plumbing or heat archie is overjoyed that the meathead is suffering but ediths motherly instinct force her to intercede she walks out and intends to suffer right along with the kids archie is all to happy to take care of himself but while making a mess in the kitchen he runs across glorias bowl from when she was a baby and it melts his heart he goes next door with a halfhearted apology and tells mike and gloria that they can stay at his house until the heat gets turned on mike and gloria begin moving into the jeffersons old house but before they move in mike speaks his mind about what he thinks of archie then the furnace breaks down and  since it requires some repairs  will delay the move bad for mike but good for archie who is just champing at the bit to get back at his loudmouthed soninlaw
