gene siskel and roger ebert review three new films and discuss the new pg13 rating for their xray segment they split on conan the destroyer 1984 qv the swordandsorcery sequel with arnold schwarzenegger reprising his role as the beefy barbarian ebert feels the second film is better than the first and has a stronger sense of purpose siskel thinks the romantic relationship of the first movie should have been followed up with a similar romance between schwarzenegger and his costar grace jones both critics give thumbs up to top secret 1984 qv the new spoof from the makers of airplane 1980 qv but siskel feels the movie lacked a coherent story while ebert believes that was unnecessary for such a goofball comedy both critics recommend under the volcano 1984 qv john hustons powerful study of an alcoholic played by albert finney they praise the adaptation of a novel that would have been impossible to film faithfully and rave the performance of finney in their special xray segment they examine the proposed new pg13 rating they agree that the rating is a good idea since the pg rating is being granted to too many violent foulmouthed films but they suggest it should be an advisory and not a demand that theater owners restrict pg13 films to children under 13 gene opens the show with a negative review of the arnold schwarzenegger adventure conan the destroyer which roger liked they both liked the elvis parody top secret with genes reservation being that story didnt work they both liked albert finneys performance in under the volcano plus in a special xray segment they discuss the newly instituted pg13 rating
