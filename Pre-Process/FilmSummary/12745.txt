located in the armpit of america is the city of detroit and in the armpit of detroit  apollos pad an extremely dirty shabby and otherwise unpleasant place where the disco balls still glitter the old vinyls still spin and flared pants never tapered apollos pad is owned and run by none other than apollo himself a beat up man whos become a mere shadow of his former self no longer bunking in any bed or dining while getting head no more digesting extinct meat while fans grovel at his feet apollo is a man stuck in the past with hopes for the present peddling the last legal drug inside an establishment which similarly to himself was once upon a time hip and popular but now is forgotten apollos pad has become a safehaven to losers the less fortunate looking to the even less fortunate where ignorance leads to unpredictable events and hysterical stories the variety of patrons is limitless however in few numbers the schemes are endless however never successful and the content unrated but never profound this is apollos pad on the surface what lies beneath the cigarette buts and spilt booze is the story of a modern black family fighting the odds struggling to remain selfishly together and make a buck while the modern world and its tempting surroundings tries to tear them and their bar apart oh and theyre puppets
