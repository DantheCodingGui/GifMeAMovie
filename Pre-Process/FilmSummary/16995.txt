baby jake plays sliding on his tummy in the snow  wheeeeeee  with pengy quin it is a very slippery snowy day and neither pengy quin nor baby jake can balance on their feet so tummy sliding proves to be best way to get around when they reach the big plug and pull it they discover a magical oceanic world where they can both swim together they find some clam shells and go for a ride in them they are perfect slidey shell boats back on the snow the clam shell boats also prove to be great toboggans for even more sliding around
