betty sparky and x5 as the band jackamoose finish a music video to be shared only amongst themselves however sparky decides to publish their music video with an album cover reminiscent of abbey road which becomes a massive hit admiral degill is shocked at a large group of intergalactic fans of jackamoose converging on moose jaw and orders betty and company to fix the problem they have caused as the fans may compromise the security of galactic guardian headquarters to do so they announce a farewell concert to be held in the school gymnasium maximus makes note of this and notices that the music jackamoose is playing was plagiarized arriving on earth maximus after a brief confrontation convinces betty of the truth sparky had indeed plagiarized maximus lyrics  it was a song that he knew as a child while watching maximus perform the music on 3v betty however is unconvinced that maximus was the original author so maximus decides to perform the music himself which causes the fans attentions to turn to maximus maximus and minimus make a hasty retreat as they are chased away from earth by their new fans if the shoe fits betty is ordered by admiral degill to broker a peace agreement between the galactic guardians and an alien race to ease communications x5 invents a translation box allowing betty to communicate with the alien race however she accidentally leaves the box at home instead taking a box with sparkys disco shoes meanwhile purrsy toys with the box and gains the ability to speak freaking out bettys mother back with the alien race betty discovers that she does not have the translation box with her but sparky reassures her that the treaty will be signed having taken a course on how to speak the alien language however he makes a diplomatic faux pas when he tries to compliment the alien leader and the two are forced to make a hasty retreat back home betty manages to round up purrsy and gets x5 to repair the machine so to take away the ability to speak meanwhile the aliens have found their way to moose jaw and are appearing to wreak havoc fortunately x5 manages to fix the translation box and use it on the alien race and they discover that in their culture compliments are taken as insults and vice versa explaining sparkys faux pas betty manages to parlay this fact into a new treaty and the aliens leave moose jaw in peace ending sketch crashtest noah animal instinks  noah tests a collar that allows the wearer to adopt the mannerisms of any animal
