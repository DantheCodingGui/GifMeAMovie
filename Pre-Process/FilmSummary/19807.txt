five wannabe entertainers who all moved to atlanta looking to be the next big thing because of inflated egos and horrible attitudes they loose out on great opportunities along the way whichever the case maybe they all are still determined to make it to the big time the only problem is that theyre not from atlanta and they have no one to lean on for money or a place to stay with opportunities running out and failure on the horizon they all answer an ad for a new reality show and reluctantly agree to move into the same house and have their lives taped all in a last ditch effort to make it big we will watch as each character faces their own individual obstacles while inadvertently helping each other achieve one dream that they all share fame
