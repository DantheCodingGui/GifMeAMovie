jamie is deep in shit from any point of view and although his pov is thats not entirely his fault it clearly is first he failed his exams but never told his parents in inverness scotland who threw him out of their home then accidentally was granted a study loan although nowhere enrolled and even managed to spend all the money on toys gifts cloths etcetera when jamies daft roommate sooz finds out she throws him out too so he ends up homeless although that was not the idea and thus gets robbed of the winning horse races bet ticket he placed with the last £10 he managed to borrow from alex the only one who remains rational enough to call jamies parents and find out who the man actually is which naive jamie just presumed to be demanding the loan back
