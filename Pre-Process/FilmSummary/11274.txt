ricky and stephen send karl on his first trip to perhaps karls worst nightmare china the reason that karl is so afraid of this locale is that what he is exposed to of chinese culture  that being solely his local chinatown  he does not understand at all and he is afraid that if he gets a taste for some exotic chinese food such as toad he wont be able to find it when he gets back home on his itinerary is beijing the great wall of china which he ends up believing is not great but a sham and shanhaiguan stephen also surprises him with some excursions namely to a fortune teller the thoughts from who karl takes to heart despite not wanting to experience it since he does not want to know bad news in advance on an extended trip to lesser section of the great wall to a kung fu school where he is not only a spectator but also a student and for a traditional hot massage which is a little hotter than he would like karl has perhaps the most issue with the public restrooms where there are no doors on the toilet stalls and the food although he can avoid the street food which is unusual to him he cant avoid the meal prepared for him on his remote visit to the great wall
