what is it to be a superstar we suspect its not at all what you think it is all of us at some time or another come to a point our lives where we need to choose what path to go down in many respects its like standing in front of a bridge  a bridge in life sortofspeak but if your goal in crossing that bridge is to become a superstar on the other side youre going to find that in crossing it youre going to be on your own that none of your friends are going to dare to go with you and that when you get to the other side youre going to lose control and the only thing you will know is that everything you know will do you no good from thereon everything on the other side of that bridge is new and the choice is yours to make your world beautiful    or to make it crap the choice is yours and yours alone our story follows the journeys of three different musical groups as they aspire to ascend toward superstardom one of the groups is poor and living in the ghetto and they are the victims of abusive relationships and broken families another group is a typical suburban garage band supported by friends and a family who loves them and cares about their dreams the third group is filthy rich  and while it would seem the rich guys could simply buy their way to the top the reality is that the one thing they want more than anything in life can not be bought now while all of these groups of musicians come from vastly diverse backgrounds and have completely different motivations for wanting to become famous underneath it all they are all the same they just dont know it yet all of them are going to cross the same bridge and on the other side all of them will face choices and all of them will have the opportunity to turn their new world into something beautiful    or to let it turn into crap the choice is theirs and theirs alone we are going to find in our story that some people  no matter how talented they may be  simply do not deserve to be famous for you can fight to make it to the top and you can struggle to get away from where youve come from    but when you get to the end of your journey and you find yourself looking into the mirror expecting to see a superstar facing back at you youre going to see the truth youre going to see more clearly than ever before all the places where youve been and all the people youve tried so hard to get away from    and youre going to realize that nothing has changed nothing but you you are somebody else now and for the first time in your life  if you are the true superstar  you will be able to see beauty in everything around you youll see it in the toughest and least likely of places and you will fly
