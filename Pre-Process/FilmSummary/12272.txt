two wealthy men respond to jesus in very different ways one who is basically good is unable to accept jesus directive that he give up the treasures of this world for the greater treasures of heaven the other a sinful publican struggles to come to grips with his emerging faith in jesus and finally accepts with his fellow man and achieving eternal salvation zacchaeus is the chief publican of jericho gaining great wealth by cheating others his young son has heard of jesus and wants to go see him but zacchaeus will not give up the opportunity to make money just to listen to a mere rabbi in the countryside a wealthy young man finds jesus preaching when he asks jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life jesus tells him to obey the commandments to sell all he has and give to the poor the rich man unable o part with his gold turns away  how difficult it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god observes jesus  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle when a man named bartimaeus is arrested he asks zacchaeus to let him hear jesus before being thrown in prison zacchaeus is troubled by the intensity of bartimaeus faith and sets him free zacchaeus then witnesses the miraculous healing of bartimaeus by jesus who says  your faith has made you whole zacchaeus struggles to come to terms with his awaking faith the things of the world have been replaced with a longing in his heart and he prays that jesus will heal him since he says i am a sinner and not worthy but jesus tells him and us i have not come to this world for righteous only but to seek and save that which is lost zacchaeus decides he will give half of his wealth to the poor and repay those he has cheated  zacchaeus  says jesus today has salvation come to your house lay not for yourself treasures on earth but lay up for yourself treasures in heaven
