albert porter reeds friend in the reserves is on his first day of patrol partnered with officer wells wells is not impressed with his geeky partner first call is to a park where they advise a young group where they can legally camp second call is a bank robbery where they are the backup to wells and porter the robbery seems to fit a pattern of other crimes where the robber is always different wears a backpack and is young reed suspects a car they pull over for a broken brake light malloy believes the young man to be okay but reed spots a problem in their story leading to their arrest reed and malloy see wells and porter with a traffic stop and stop to check out the situation porter accidentally backs the stopped car into their patrol car malloy and reed are called to another bank robbery where they corner the suspect and learn that he is wearing a bomb and is being forced to holdup the bank the man behind the robberies forces the suspect to flee with him in a car chase at a dead end the man tosses the backpack to wells trying to hold him hostage porter suspects a fake bomb and yanks it away from wells reeds friend from night school al porter finished first in his reserve class and has drawn ed wells as a partner for his first patrol in reeds mind wells is probably the worst officer that porter could have drawn as wells is a hard nosed guys kind of guy whereas porter is much softer in his approach reed just hopes that malloy is correct that if porter does his job wells will treat him fairly malloy and reed are first called to a park where a group of kids outoftowners were planning on camping overnight illegally as they have no place to stay after the rock concert they attend generally suspect of the law the kids end up being surprised by malloy and reed next they are called to a robbery in progress at a bank by the time they arrive the robber was gone this was the fourth such bank robbery in the area in a week all using the same mo but the description of the robber being different each time malloy believes something the latest robber continually said to the most recent held up teller may be a key piece of information but they may never find out if it has any significance unless they catch the perpetrator or perpetrators in the progress of a robbery then they pull over a vehicle with a nonfunctioning brake light they believe there may be something more as the driver seems a bit worried at seeing them what is in the back seat of the vehicle may provide a key if their initial hunch is correct adam12 attended some of these calls with wells and porter and shadowed them on another one incident in particular may demonstrate if porter will have any chance of success as an onpatrol reservist regardless of wells continual digs at him
