\nUSA, summer of 1969. Man is about to walk on the moon, the Vietnam War is breaking out, and there is the great concert in Woodstock. In a holiday camp for Jewish families not far from Woodstock, Alison and her family are on vacation. Pearl, the mother is young and attractive, but defeated by life, having become pregnant on her first loving relationship, forgetting her dreams to devote herself to her children. Marty, the father is absent because he is busily occupied working at a television repair business. One day a charming salesman arrives at the camp, selling clothes and knick-knacks. He lives an intense life of love and passion, culminating in an escape to Woodstock with Pearl, where events have a deep impact.                ',
