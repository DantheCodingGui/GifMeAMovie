vera and elliot celebrate their anniversary by reenacting their first meeting which was elliot arresting vera for jaywalking when vera sees a cop across the street thinking its elliot goes out to meet but discovers its not elliot and the cop cites her later when she sees whom she thinks is elliot she goes out again only to be arrested by the same cop again and when she tries to reason with him and when she thinks she got to him she rips up the citation he then arrests vera elliot goes to see her at the station and apologizes but when he cant remember their song things go bad again
