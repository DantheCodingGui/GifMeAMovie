mr cole is the priority then we worry about the core jones tells her team in tonights episode shes speaking of the tracer signal staying locked on cole tracking him in time and space is the single most important task all future missions rely upon calling him back and that need eclipses all others including the need to preserve the machinery but it functions as a metaphor for the show as well stay locked on cole and the story stays strong lose sight of him and it falters the characters and emotional arcs of 12 monkeys have stumbled over its eight episodes but the story mechanics stayed strong the show has clearly conveyed the potentially confusing jumps through time and space with seemingly effortless focus and kept the larger narrative free of distractions by keeping everything centered tightly around james cole until tonight yesterday inverts most of the expectations the series has established not entirely successfully cole spends his scant minutes of the episode in a dark cellar while his compatriots from 2043 leave their shadowy timetravel bunker for the sunny spacious halls of spearhead a longstanding postplague institute searching for a cure to the constantly mutating virus years ago col foster xander berkeley staged a coup assassinating the worlds military and political leaders when they proposed to abandon medical research in favor of retreating to isolation his teams have harvested every hard drive server and processor within 500 miles building a vast network with one goal to find a cure for the plague with jones help he says they can be one year from engineering a vaccine capable of predicting viral shifts before they occur in 2043 the time machine malfunctions forcing the team to abort coles return dr jones sends ramse and whitley to spearhead to get the stabilizer they need the get the core functioning functioning properly spearhead is run by col jonathan foster and is dedicated to finding a cure to virus he clearly doesnt have much faith in jones project to change the past when jones tries to bring cole back she damages the core beyond repair there is only one place to find a replacement in 2015 its the week of the chechnya explosion coles body was never found in the debris and cassie travels to chechnya to confirm that he is dead
