with three rounds already played the g revolutions team finds themselves with an unimpressive record two matches lost and one ending in a draw tyson and the rest of the team are practicing furiously to guarantee a check in the win column for tomorrows big match the bad news is no one on the team has the same skill with the hard metal beyblade as tyson does or at least thats what he thinks and he refuses to choose any of his teammates to blade in the last round of the tournament insisting instead to blade both rounds himself as all of the others vie for the last spot kais frustration at his lack of control with his new hard metal beyblade reaches an alltime high combine that with his anger at what happened to tala and kais mood is even less cheery than usual it isnt until he connects with an unlikely blading opponent that he gains the technique hes been seeking for so longthe real question is will tyson and the rest of the gang welcome kai back after all theyve been through in the past
