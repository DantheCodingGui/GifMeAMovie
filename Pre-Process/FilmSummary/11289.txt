for the latest proposed travel adventure of marco polos route from venice to china karl wants to take along a mate for support and companionship who ricky assigns is warwick davis i qv who karl believes will be more of a hindrance than an asset if only because of his dwarf stature but as their stay in their first locale  venice  progresses karl realizes that the biggest problem with warwick as an adventure travel partner is their total incompatibility in terms of what they want to do and experience their first warwick chosen event is to attend a masquerade ball which is a ritual of the area dating back centuries their choice of costumes reflects what they want to portray of themselves although karl feels less inclined to partake in the masquerade portion of the costume selection this warwick chosen activity is balanced by a karl chosen activity using a jet pack to fly over the canals this activity ends up being a little less fun than karl had anticipated they then take a short cut from marco polos route to go to macedonia first to hang out with romani gypsies then on warwicks suggestion for both their enjoyment they go to see practitioners of sufi islam they who perform mystical exercises karl is surprised that he himself enjoys participating in the ritual of the exercises until finally on rickys want karl goes up in the air attached to oversized helium balloons but karl figures what is good for the goose is also good for the gander which doesnt sit well with either ricky or warwick if only for karls rationale
