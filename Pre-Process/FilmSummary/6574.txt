amazingly well done documentary style series that utilizes interviews of the real men involved in extraordinary military conflict situations that against the odds lived to tell their story of heroism and resiliency a great use of real world action clips from the battles themselves from all wars including wwii vietnam korea and iraq what some of these units of men went though to in many cases change the course of the wars is absolutely inspiring
