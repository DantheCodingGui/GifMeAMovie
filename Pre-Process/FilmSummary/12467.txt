at the meeting laura is about to perform her song but one note on the piano sounds very odd steve looks more deeply into the piano than anyone bothered to do during the hunt for the necklace and he finds it laura apologizes to annette although not without making excuses for her suspicions and asks if they can try to be friends annette agrees jet and laura also resolve their differences and the gang sings dont jump to conclusions laura is clearly the object of drews fascination but she may have lost steve to jet as they stick close together as do annette and mike when she gets home annette tells her family the happy news that her recent miseries are over and she has a lunch date with mike they all head to the kitchen for warm milk
