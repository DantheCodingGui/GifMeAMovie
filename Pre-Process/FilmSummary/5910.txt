while on break malloy and reed learn that an old friend jennings thornton is back he likes to play cop  a cop buff first call is to a store where a young inexperienced clerk had an expensive ring swapped for a cheap one this is followed by their friend thorton calling in a drunk driver he encountered a call about a robbery at a store results in a shootout in the parking lot but the shooter has a flak jacket thorton runs down the shooter with his car to end it but putting reed in danger  the officers take a call at a parking lot where a minor accident has occurred the woman has no id and appears to be the woman who stole the ring they arrest her but the clerk cannot identify her they receive another call where thorton used a gun to arrest two young men for stealing mag wheels however they were the legal owners of the wheels and the roles are reversed with thorton under arrest mac arrives to say they found the ring on the woman at central booking making for a very good day malloy and reed are dismayed to have to inform their fellow officers that they ran into jennings thornton who they believed was out of their lives since no one had seen him for a while thornton is their resident buff ie someone who has most of the police equipment to follow police goings on including attending and implicating oneself as the law at crime scenes however malloy in particular is aware that thorntons motives are not to help the police but to show them that he can do their job better than they can he has no friends on the force especially as he once implicated an officer for misconduct that was his own doing malloy and reed are up front with him that although they appreciate citizen involvement they dont want or need citizen vigilantism which can hinder police work among the calls they attend which thornton does not is a department store jewelry heist where a middle aged woman palmed a 1500 ring while a naive nearsighted clerk was working they later attend a call at a parking lot where coincidentally they find circumstantial evidence regarding the department store heist unfortunately malloy and reed do encounter thornton at several of their calls during this shift at which thornton gives his little digs about how they wouldnt be able to do their work without him but thornton may go just a little too far especially in the eyes of the law
