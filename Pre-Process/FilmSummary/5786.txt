malloy has won 10000 in a womans shampoo naming contest and is being bombarded with mail at work and suggestions from reed on how to invest the money but malloy wants a new boat opening call is a loud noise complaint from an elderly gentleman about a new elderly female tenant and her irish music malloy and reed explain the complaint and introduce the couple to each other and quietly leave them together while on patrol a sniper starts shooting and they call in support resulting in them shooting the sniper in a car while fleeing a theft report call is a man in an expensive home that appears to have been stripped in fact due to his financial ruin and three wives the only items left were two cameras and a tv that were stolen a call about body in alley is a wino killed for his new tennis shoes as they leave the scene the officers spot another wino wearing new tennis shoes sleeping it off in a junked car malloy realizing reed has his best interests at heart presents reed with a gift of a single share of stock worth 5 to develop a nest egg malloy has just won half of a 10000 grand prize in a contest which in many ways is more a problem than a benefit he gets ribbed for the nature of the contest which he divulges to as few people as possible and every insurance company and the like are sending him unsolicited mail to the police station advising him how to invest the money reed too cant help but constantly provide his twocents worth of advice malloy who really doesnt want to listen as he already knows he wants to buy a boat with his 5000 still reed uses a small issue from almost every call they take over the next few days as an opportunity to reiterate his investment advice to his partner those calls include a noise complaint which perhaps wasnt really a complaint after all a sniper atop a parking garage a robbery where the robbery itself is the least of the victims worries and the death and theft of a drunk who came into some money after all is said and done malloy thinks he knows how to quiet reed concerning the unsolicited investment advice
