the officers are on loan to lax airport the first case is a man taking a stewardess hostage because he wants a job with a specific film director in la they convince the man that the director is on the phone to distract him the police are given a tip by another police department that a shipment of drugs is arriving in a suitcase they tail the suitcase and arrest a group of men making separate drug pickups at the airport leading to a huge bust final call is a woman who is picked up by man posing as a limo driver he pistol whips robs and dumps her but she tears his shirt they find the car and a tip leads them to the suspect in the airport malloy and reed arent sure what to expect when they agree to a weeklong vacation relief detail at the lax substation the small substation belies the fact of the work being no less taxing than their regular detail they quickly learn that one of the challenges of the airport is the high volume of primarily transients their primary detail is to patrol the 6000 stall parking lot where many car breakins and thefts occur however their first assignment sends them to an employee lounge where an aspiring actor having not made it through any hollywood doors takes a stewardess hostage until he gets a meeting with a specific producer he threatens to kill the stewardess then himself if a meeting with the producer and resulting acting job does not happen as malloy and reed know they cannot get the producer they have to find a way to neutralize the situation while getting the stewardess to safety next they going undercover as rental car employees are tasked with following whoever picks pick a specific piece of luggage coming in from a flight from toledo the lapd were informed by tpd that the suitcase broke open in the baggage handling area of toledo airport exposing the suitcases contents of illicit drugs malloy and reed have to find its intended end point then they are called to an injured woman found just outside the airport property she apparently had been picked up at an airport terminal by a supposed legitimate limo driver who assaulted her she managed to get a small piece of evidence from her attacker which malloy and reed hope is enough of a lead to nab the perpetrator eventually
