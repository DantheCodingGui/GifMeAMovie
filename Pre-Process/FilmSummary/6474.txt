chelsea has brought in a denver based super fan a wheelchairridden physically disabled eighteen year old named jordan to be guest assistant in chuys place for a show after brad learns that some of the shows interns took jordan out for a sedate night on the town the previous night brad convinces chris and josh to join him in taking jordan out this evening each of the three staffers who has his own motivation for wanting to be part of the outing they may all regret it when each assumes that one of the other two saw jordan back to his hotel at the end of the night while none of the three did they now have to find out what happened to jordan meanwhile chelsea has a medical issue which is making her pass excessive and quite smelly gas she has to provide a stool sample for analysis to determine her medical issue despite being reluctant to poop in a box chelsea does and asks jiffy to take it to the medical lab for her rather than be grossed out by his cargo jiffy feels privileged to do this task for chelsea but a comment by brad may change his feeling about it and heather is angry that promotional items sent through the talent department for the talent has been staying with the talent department
