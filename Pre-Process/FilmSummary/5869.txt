a pair of black hoodlums shoot and kill a respected black couple during a grocery store robbery reed and malloy sent in to capture the killers they keep their cool knowing that given the heightened racial tensions the wrong thing said could spark deadly violence and are assisted by a young resident who helps to keep the peace sgt macdonald is concerned about reeds heavy handed judge and jury dealing with a charged child molester especially as reed is still on his first year probation reed later admits that the thought of his own still unborn child affected his judgment as continuing such behavior could cause a problem for reeds career malloy vows to the sergeant to keep an eye on reed with regard to this issue malloy figures their calls for the day may be a good starting point for reed in handling his feelings with regard to possible child harm cases the first is a woman suspecting that her former neighbors who just moved and who she didnt like killed their two year old daughter based on their past behavior and the rotting smell emanating from somewhere in their back yard the second is a chronic home invasion in which a child is used to exploit the situation their final call is at an armed robbery at a supermarket where race relations plays a large role in the outcome at the end of the day reed still doesnt know if he can make it as a cop if he has to deal with child harm but malloy has other beliefs
