dr robert winchester is a brilliant researcher and a former test pilot who helped design airwolf now hes asking for hawkes help in test flying a simulator that hes designed to enable the firm to train future test pilots to fly airwolf reluctantly hawke agrees but determines that the simulators feel is a little off archangel convinces hawke to let winchester hook up the real airwolf to his computers in order to get a more realistic demonstration this allows winchester to engage in a little friendly flying competition with hawke but it also allows the russians to nearly get their hands on the high tech super copter
