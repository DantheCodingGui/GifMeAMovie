louise adams 14 is new to cranford  and she doesnt like it cranford is a place where people either fit in or move on and louise knows which of her options shed prefer she and her mother kath have moved to this old mining town after the disastrous breakup of the adams marriage despite her very good relationship with kath louise is so bitter about the circumstances of the divorce and in particular her fathers new partner that she is determined not to make any effort in her new school or her new life  in short not to trust anyone ever again her only consolations are running  at which she excels  and her loyal setter minty louises talent at track has been noticed  both by the crusty but lovable coach mike horan late 60s and anna and pat two girls from cranford high who first meet louise at the yacht club with her father and are anxious to be friends however louise rebuffs approaches from both parties  she wont join the track team and shed rather not socialize at all thanks lous highschool teacher mrs yates is beginning to be concerned about her she feels that perhaps it is time for louise to have some counseling kath is alarmed by the suggestion and lou rejects it out of hand all she wants is to be left alone as far as she is concerned her running is therapy enough louises favorite place to run is by the nowdefunct mine along the tracks that wind up through the wooded mountain the only people in the town who take an active interest in the mine are mike horan who still pans for the tiny flecks of gold there are left and the mysterious charlie 17 a pale withdrawn boy who wears the cranford high tracksuit but is never seen in school louise has seen charlie in the distance on several of her runs but whenever she rounds a corner after him its as if hes vanished into thin air louises class is working on a project researching cranford and its history mrs yates tries to encourage louise to join in with a group but she insists on working by herself  and for good measure rejects another invitation from anna to come with the other kids to the local hangout after school instead lou goes to the library alone to begin research on the mines  and looks up to find charlie watching her silently from across the stacks  but before she can approach him he has gone louise is becoming genuinely interested in the history of the mines on her next run she takes her camera with her to get some photographs for the project to her annoyance charlie runs into frame just as the shutter descends its not a propitious first meeting hes no more happy about having his photo taken than she is about having her shot of the deserted shaft ruined to add insult to injury charlie tries to persuade louise to stay away from the mines in future  out of danger the fiercely independent lou is infuriated but it seems she need not have worried about charlie spoiling her photo to her bewilderment none of the prints show his image at all and no one at the small school seems to know whom shes talking about when she describes him mrs yates has a suggestion to further her work however  to check the cranford gazette morgue or archives to see what old material might be held about the mines louise finds none other than mike horan running the morgue in mike she recognizes a kindred spirit despite her stubborn refusal to join his precious track squad mike too is a little uneasy about lou continuing to run so close to the pits when she describes the boy who warned her off he listens closely  then finds her a photograph of charlie dated  1961 but how can a photograph of the adolescent boy she met be thirtysix years old why does her presence on the mountain make him so nervous and what does any of it have to do with mike horan louises next encounter with charlie is dramatic in her wish to be totally selfsufficient she has paid too little attention to warnings about the danger of the mine we open on her frozen with fear at the lip of the cranford pit beyond the danger signals and the protecting fences charlie approaches silently from behind her  there is a frightening moment when it seems he might be about to push louise to her death instead he seizes her wrist and pulls her clear just as the edge of the shaft caves in its certainly a hell of an icebreaker and quite soon  to the evident pleasure of both of them  the two are chatting like old friends charlie shares lous interest in the workings of the old mine and between that their shared loner status and their joint excellence at running they are well on the way to feeling they are soul mates neither kath nor at first minty share louises pleasure in her newfound friendship with charlie the loyal dog is curiously uneasy in the boys presence kath just cant understand why lou wont bring him home to meet her and  herself still hurting from her recent divorce  shes suspicious of charlies motives louise is indignant  isnt making friends exactly what kath has been bothering her to do she feels comfortable with charlie in a way she hasnt felt with anyone in a very long time she feels she can trust him that she can confide in him and that he does not judge her apart from mike charlie is the only person she tells about her sense of lens betrayal charlie is empathic  the loss even the perceived loss of a father is very difficult and lonely he knows he lost his own back at school louise participates no more than she did before and is being singled out by the school bully brenda and a couple of her nasty cronies theyre scornful of her stories of charlie  oh right the invisible boyfriend the one in the photograph who wasnt there louise tells herself she doesnt care  she spends more and more time with charlie who even minty has grown friendly toward they run and hike and fish together but to louises disappointment charlie always refuses to come down into the town with her and meet kath or go to one of the school socials clearly the situation cannot continue as it is forever and the crisis comes when brenda spies on louise and charlie  and discovers louise apparently talking to herself brenda tells anna and pat that lous crazy talking to trees  and the adults concern about louise and this mysterious boyfriend comes to a head lous furious  she feels invaded and misunderstood she goes to mike for comfort and he shows her an astonishing thing blackandwhite footage of the disaster that finally closed the struggling mine three men were trapped below we see stepping forward to volunteer  charlie the photographs the footage the fact that no one else seems ever to have seen charlie  louise is totally bewildered mike sends her to ask charlie about it himself finally charlie explains his fathers death in korea forty years before and his mothers following soon thereafter left him feeling bitter and hopeless he volunteered for the rescue mission because he didnt care what happened to him any more and rescue he did  mike horan who was partly crippled in the accident but escaped with his life and in this he was luckier than charlie louise cries as charlie tells her that she must never allow herself to feel hopeless or bitter what she has is not a rehearsal it is the real thing  her only life she must forgive her father and be brave enough to trust other people again  and she must do one more thing for him charlie to allow him to finally rest in peace mike horan has become almost frantic with worry as louise has still not come home from his point of view we find her standing at the edge of the pit  is she about to throw herself in but then louise drops into the void a bunch of yellow roses  she looks round to find mike smiling at her this was her last gift to charlie the grief at his untimely death of someone who loved him they return home to find kath in a state of great excitement this boyfriend of louises has gone right over the top her room is filled to bursting with  yellow roses
