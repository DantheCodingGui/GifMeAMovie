when karl is told that his next trip will be to rio de janeiro to see christ the redeemer atop corcovado his first reaction is that it is akin to a pylon something that is there everyday that people probably get tired of seeing what ricky and stephen dont tell him until he arrives in rio is that they want him to be more social on his trips as such they place him in a dorm room in a hostel they do tell him that carnival will be happening while hes there hes not too excited about it as he hates crowds and he presupposes its a gay event which makes him feel uncomfortable but he is thrown into the festivities whether he likes it or not his anxiety at crowds is heightened when he is told he is also to attend a block party he remarks at the dichotomy between the catholic nature of the statue towering over the city versus the overt sexuality displayed by the people especially at the beach his discomfort increases with interactions with his guide celso which includes excursions to make sure karl looks his best at the beach a stop at the particular section of beach and an invitation to stay the night at his place and much like his sights were overwhelmed in india his sense of hearing is overwhelmed throughout his stay in the city he searches for a sanctuary which doesnt end up being what he expects when he finally goes to see christ the redeemer will he still liken it to a pylon he is given a slightly different perspective when he is taken on a helicopter ride around the monument
