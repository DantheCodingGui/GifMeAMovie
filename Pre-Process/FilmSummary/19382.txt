when a viewer expresses exasperation over understanding the concept of momentum beakman first calls on professor boring who says it is the product of a bodys mass and its linear velocity hoping to improve on this definition beakman notes that an objects momentum depends both upon how fast it is moving and how much it weighs and then uses a bowling ball and a baseball each rolling down a pair of identical ramps to demonstrate but showing the results can be changed by altering velocity he proves that the baseballs momentum can be increased by propelling it down the ramp and then reminds a skeptical lester that understanding momentum is critical in designing brakes launching satellites and building roller coasters for beakmania beakman illuminates some facts about the octopus reveals that there actually was a tower of babel constructed in mesopotamia in the sixth century bc and says that clarence birdseye developed frozen foods after observing eskimos then after convincing beakman to have the liza challenge liza shows a befuddled lester how to make a coin fall into a bottle from a precariously balanced plastic loop turning to a series of viewer questions about cows beakman begins by explaining that cows dont really have four stomachs but a single stomach with four separate chambers then after using the boguscope to show how they chew grass and then regurgitate it to be chewed again beakman shows how the stomach breaks down this digested food to produce milk which is white because of the colors of its component proteins vitamins minerals fats and sugars then after lester demonstrates his milking technique beakman notes that several different kinds of milk along with a variety of other dairy products including butter are all made from this single product of cows
