on pm watch reed and malloy assist wells and brady at a domestic dispute involving an armed husband they investigate the report of a possible dead body and later the robbery of a pawn shop at the gun range the next day reed and malloy along with wells and brady among others practice before their monthly qualification later a cabbie tips them on what he thinks is a burglary in progress they get a hit on prints taken at the pawn shop the night before and find the suspect working at a car wash he tries for a clean getaway but pulls a gun instead and is caught after nightfall they back up wells and brady again on a prowler call this time where the homeowner takes a shot at a suspected prowler malloy and reeds latest calls deal largely with ordinary citizens owning guns and what can and does often go wrong especially if those gun owners dont know the law their first case takes them to a serial domestic dispute where neither side seems ever to want to press charges this latest call involves the husband buying a gun he says for one relatively innocent reason while the wife believes it is for another more nefarious purpose next they are called to what looks like a dead body in the bushes they learn that the dead body is mrs juniper with whose best friend malloy and reed will have tea they then are called to a robbery at a pawn shop where the robber used the shop owners gun against him malloy and reed will hope that ident can recover evidence at the scene for them to apprehend the robber they are then off to the shooting range for recertification but not before wells teaches his wifes female cousin to shoot she who just bought a gun which is something she thought shed never do next they get a call about a man trying to break into an apartment building by scaling the side of it they will learn from the man that he has other reasons for scaling the wall than to steal their last call late at night takes them to a residential prowler case which has the potential to go terribly wrong because of the homeowner and his gun malloy and reed encounter wells and his latest partner brady through many of these calls the two who openly and publicly feud with each other about police procedure the question becomes if there is anything that can be done to mend their rift if not brady may have to resort to requesting a new partner which will mean that wells will have had six different partners in a three year time span
