the tournament in australia continues and this round pits the ppb all starz against tyson and the bba revolution the first battle sees daichi playing against rick daichi seems a little over confident going into battle as his sights are set on the bigger prize fighting in the finals with tyson rick on the other hand is more realistic he understands where he comes from and that hes lucky to be where he is yet he too wants to get this battle behind him the fight is a tough one in fact the combatants are going at it so hard that the entire arena is filled with the acrid smell of burnt metal this seems to be a battle of wills rather than blades as each blader attempts to summon every ounce of power that they can in the end daichi proves to be the winner and rick is devastated daichi on the other hand has used so much energy that he passes out now its time for the next round and it pits tyson against his former teammate max
