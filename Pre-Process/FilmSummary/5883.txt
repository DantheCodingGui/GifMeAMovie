two young men are stalking malloy and reed while on duty taking pictures and talking to bystanders they insinuate that the officers are frequently mistreating citizens they attempt to interfere when the officers are asked to notify a woman that her merchant marine husband has passed away after picking up a man on drugs and alcohol who injuries himself in the squad car the men accuse the officers of injuring the man the officers stop a car with three men wanted in a robbery the two men appear and interfere with the officers resulting in one of the suspects pulling a gun and shooting an innocent bystander in carrying out their duties malloy and reed have of late been unwantedly shadowed by two young men mark gurney and jerry bowen who seem intent on provoking some sort of negative reaction from malloy and reed gurney and bowen are able to follow adam12 because they have a police scanner installed in their car their outward motive is to provide public oversight into the workings of the police a public body however malloy and reed probably rightly believe that gurney and bowen just want to create a sensational story regardless of the consequences even when malloy and reed are given the thankless task of informing a woman that her husband has just died gurney and bowen seem more interested in the story rather than the feelings of the grieving widow malloy has to control reed who is more irritated of the two officers into not doing anything stupid just because of gurney and reeds presence their standoff seemingly wont end until malloy andor reed do that something stupid in gurney and bowens presence or if something perceived as being improper on malloy andor reeds part is done based on circumstantial evidence conversely but no less tragic the standoff may end if gurney andor bowens interference causes an incident in and of itself
