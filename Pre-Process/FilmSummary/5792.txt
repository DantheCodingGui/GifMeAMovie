on a prowler report at a nonexistent address someone fires multiple rounds at the officers next day on a run to a heliport to pick up a blood donor they are again fired upon evidence points to the same shooter both times and reveals that adam12 is being targeted by a man known to pass bad checks reeds wife receives a call indicating that reed is the target a man tries to kill himself with gasoline at a gas station but malloy stops him using a fire extinguisher another nighttime prowler call turns up a wino that reed comes close to shooting malloy drops reed off at his house when a man walks by known to reed and tells him that his car has broken down reed offers to let him use his phone malloy notices there is a car like the one the suspect is supposed to be driving down the street as he leaves while attending to a domestic dispute call late one night malloy and reed are surprised to find the house in question quiet and pitch black just as they are about to call to confirm the address they are shot at from somewhere in the dark the sniper not hitting either of them they then come to the realization that the domestic dispute call was a setup they have no idea if they were the intended targets or the police in general the next day they are asked to escort a young woman from the helipad to the hospital she who has come into town as a rare type blood donor for an emergency surgery as soon as they are about to provide that escort service to her they are again shot at and again they and their passenger are not hit this time the snipers shooting location is determined and evidence retrieved indicates that either malloy andor reed is the intended target after going through old arrest reports for anything that may stand out as being out of the ordinary however without luck the target is identified when jean receives a suspicious telephone call leading to reed getting her and jimmy out of harms way until the person out to get him is caught they also retrieve evidence that the person trying to kill reed is known to the police as someone who passes bad checks which doesnt raise any flags in reeds mind this situation does not make adam12s work life any easier as they need to be hypervigilant about every call they attend which includes a man attempting suicide at a gas station by lighting himself on fire and a suspected prowler outside a home
