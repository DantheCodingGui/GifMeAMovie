\nMegan is an all-American girl. She\'s a cheerleader and has a boyfriend, but she doesn\'t like kissing him very much, and she\'s pretty tactile with her cheerleader friends, and she only has pictures of girls up in her locker. Her parents and friends conclude that she *must* be gay and send her off to "sexual redirection" school, full of admittedly homosexual misfits, where she can learn how to be straight. Will Megan be turned around to successful heterosexuality, or will she succumb to her love for the beautiful Graham?                ',
