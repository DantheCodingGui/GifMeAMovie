i love this episode where we stepped inside the film american splendor with michael ruhlman markie ramone michael symon and the incredible harvey pekar and family and friends rarely has a show worked out exactly as planned but this is a rare example the shooting and post production on this show are remarkable  particularly the fades from comic book into live action
