gene opens the show with a negative review of the kristy mcnichol love story just the way you are which he thought it was a lowrent tv movie roger didnt believe the main plot element they split on the terminator thought that despite nonstop acting it was well acted and executed gene didnt like it because he thought it was all routine they both gave big thumbs up to both the killing fields and comfort and joy
