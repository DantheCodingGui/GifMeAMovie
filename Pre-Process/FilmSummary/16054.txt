now aged 48 and a grandfather joe bugner is still standing and still fighting though by most peoples reckoning he should have retired years ago but his refusal to give in to the passage of time and his easy amiability have made him a hero to many sports fans who revere him as aussie joe despite his european upbringing we catch up with joe and his wife marlene in the nailbiting lead up to his australian heavyweight title defence on the gold coast on april 20 on the night of the fight itself we will see the unfolding events through the eyes of both joe and marlene the anxious wife who says she hates boxing if joe beats his opponent bob merovic he will also collect the panasian title which will not only give him a world top 10 ranking but a crack at a world title that has long eluded him
