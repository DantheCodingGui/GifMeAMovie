gene siskel and roger ebert review four new movies the critics split on the man with two brains 1983 qv siskel thought it was funny ebert laughed too but not enough to recommend it ebert concedes however that he is finally starting to warm to its star steve martin whom he detested in earlier films neither critic can recommend superman iii 1983 qv which is much weaker than the earlier superman flicks and wastes richard pryor who is far too nice both critics love trading places 1983 qv a hilarious comedy with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy which ebert compares to the work of frank capra and preston sturges finally the two critics concede that psycho ii 1983 qv is well made but they cant recommend it it adds nothing to alfred hitchcocks original film and is therefore unnecessary
