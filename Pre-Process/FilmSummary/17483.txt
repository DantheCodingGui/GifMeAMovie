without warning a match is announced in town featuring bladers from the new bega league run by boris tyson and his crew are skeptical of this new band of bladers so they decide to go scope out the event once there they find garland and tala going head to head all under the supervision of boris who observes from the wings an intense battle is played out on the stadium floor when it looks like tala is about to lose bars rise up out of the floor and keep him in the dish as they continue to battle tala becomes weaker and weaker and collapses tysons had enough he yells out at boris telling him his whole bega outfit is bogus and he challenges the shadowy figure to a battle boris accepts the challenges and at stake is the future of the bega and tysons future as a beyblader most of tysons friends surround him in a show of support except one kai walks out of the stands and walks right by tyson leaving him high and dry
