pam and cheryl are gabbing on their way to isis and they are once again late for work a van approaches the pair and men proceed to kidnap one of them life is so damned unfair cheryl did not even take time off last week when her parents were killed in a car accident this could make her really late when the nonkidnapped drone reaches isis she receives a very lukewarm welcome until railroads and tunts arise then it becomes all about kidnappers voice modulation software and how much ones colleagues value a coworker perhaps perennial cheapskate malory is not the best person to ask lana is horrified later she is literally wet with jealousy and the fearless isis crew operates with its usual efficiency to save its team member how much of a piece of malory will an angry exkidnap victim demand can malory afford to lose it how many times will brett get shot before the isis liability insurer cancels them for good
