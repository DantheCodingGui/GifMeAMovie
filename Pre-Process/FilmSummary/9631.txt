"\nA fable of innocence: thirteen-year-old Aviva Victor wants to be a 'mom'. She does all she can to make this happen, and comes very close to succeeding, but in the end her plan is thwarted by her sensible parents.

She takes a road trip from the suburbs of New Jersey, through Ohio to the plains of Kansas and back.
