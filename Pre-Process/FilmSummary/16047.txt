seven years ago tim mccallum was accepted into the prestigious academy of performing arts in western australia it was the culmination of a childhood dream waapa has famously provided the launching pad for well known performers including hugh jackman and lisa mccune but three days after arriving in wa to start his studies tim mccallum broke his neck in an accident in the surf he was left paralysed from the chest down with only partial use of his arms it seemed there was no realistic prospect of him ever being able to sing again but derek bond a lecturer from the academy visited tim in hospital every second day and encouraged him to continue music studies and to try to use his voice again anyone who sings knows the support you have to get from the diaphragm and if you havent got all those muscles working there for you then you have to work in another way says bond at first it was a struggle but gradually and remarkably the power in tim mccallums voice returned a surprise call from international producer and choreographer david atkins opened the door to a return to the stage and mccallum performed in front of thousands in atkins spectacular dreamscape at the melbourne tennis centre other work soon followed and tim mccallum has performed in les miserables the sound of music sweeney todd and most recently in rent at the geelong performing arts centre
