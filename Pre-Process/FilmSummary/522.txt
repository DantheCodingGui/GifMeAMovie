suffering from fatigue general savage is ordered to take leave and decides to pay a visit to sunny scotland on his way he repeatedly bumps into a female british officer ann macrae who is returning to her home  accidental encounters that become increasingly awkward naturally their animosity slowly turns to grudging tolerance and then to fondness on the way to true affection against his better judgment savage finds himself falling in love and macrae is caught in the same web unfortunately she is hiding a secret that will cast a terrible shadow over their budding relationship by the time bomber losses have made savage seem inhumanly hard and unfeeling general crowe orders him on leave before savage has a breakdown at the train station savage buys passage to inverness scotland just behind a lovely wren lt ann macrae whose friends have come to the station to bid her a tearful farewell shes brave until they give her a gift of wartime treasure  a pound of bacon  then shes in tears as well its the bacon that cements the acquaintance with savage when he accidentally knocks it out the train window losing the bacon forever ann is furious with savage then later contrite at her anger and by the time its all cleared up theyre friends accidentally savage is going to the same place as ann but she doesnt tell him shes going home for good when his leave is up they part sadly and it is only by coming back impulsively with a gift of a ten pound ham to replace the bacon that savage learns ann is dying
