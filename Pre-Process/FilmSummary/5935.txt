reed cant think about much beyond malloy paying off his lost bet to him the payoff a nice french dinner out for him and his wife malloy on the other hand would rather forget the entire bet but first they will have to deal with two calls where some of the supposed victims in question are less than cooperative first they are called to an upscale home where the maid reports a missing sevenmonth old infant but when the homeowners the wilkinsons arrive home they acting suspiciously tell malloy and reed that the infant is with its grandmother and second they are called to a home with a suspected prowler upon their arrival they do find a man outside trying to get into the home but the young mother inside who is also acting suspiciously says the supposed prowler is indeed a man she knows malloy and reed just hope that the two sets of victims will voluntarily come forward with whatever they are hiding next they deal with a theft at a colleges football team locker room the robbers ransacked the medicine cabinet which the trainer states was filled solely with vitamins but the trainer also admits that he really has no idea what was in the medicine cabinet as he is told by the team doctor and coach which pills to administer to players without he knowing what those pills are only the coach and doctor in question can answer if there was more in the cabinet than just vitamins the robber may have motives other than personal use or sale of the drugs and while on patrol they notice one muscle car seemingly chasing another which leads to their vehicle being added to the high speed pursuit after all is said and done the thought of a rich and out of the ordinary french dinner may be more appealing in theory than practice
