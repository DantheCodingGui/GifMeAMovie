the officers are in a driver refresher course where their driving skills are honed and tested the department wants to prevent patrol car accidents officer wells has proposed a new strategy to deal with the theft of car accessories that they put into action on their return to duty they ride bicycles as paperboys to prevent the thieves hiding from the police on patrol by laying down on the sidewalk side of the car malloy encounters an irate customer thinking he is her paperboy but the strategy works however officer wells wrecks his bicycle and has to explain it to the little girl who owns it reed hounds malloy to drive now that they have gone through driving school but malloy wont give up the wheel they pull over a man in a vw bus who rails on the police tactics however he is carrying a parrot that says down with the pigs malloy gives the man a warning and both officers have a laugh about it a call to a breakin at an auto dealership leads to a high speed chase malloy backs off on the chase when they think the man is cornered but the man wraps the car around a tree malloy and reed are two of several officers in for a drivers refresher course which they both pass with flying colors because of his performance reed wants more opportunity to drive while on patrol reeds performance is important as he has made a bet with wells about their respective outcomes while there wells tells malloy that he has made a proposal to brass about how to combat the rash of vehicle strippings ie thefts of items such as car stereos however wells wont divulge the proposal to malloy reed driving will have to wait as malloy and reed do find out about wells approved proposal with malloy and reed included on the first shift of its implementation bike patrols in the middle of the night those patrols masquerading as newspaper boys wells proposal ends up having two unexpected consequences on their regular patrol with malloy not relinquishing the steering wheel adam12 stops a hippie vehicle for a minor traffic violation its driver who is hypocritical in his approach to the officers and while checking out a robbery in progress they end up in a high speed pursuit which will really test if malloy was paying attention in the drivers course
