groby temporal clockmaker bon vivant and black wizard has lived alone on his own private beach for longer than anyone can remember he claims the land was given to his father in perpetuity  but the local town council can prove otherwise they are determined to erect budget holiday chalets for city families on just a hundred yards of the land groby is accustomed to calling his own twenty adults and perhaps sixty children staying within spitting distance  it is at this point that the councilors start mysteriously disappearing one by one  three penniless orphans  murray 12 ruth 12 and dot 10  are the only children from the home left unclaimed for the holiday period wandering disconsolately in the woods they discover and rescue a dog caught in a rabbit snare in return vespa leads them to her home the magical house of miss angela dwelf charming and eccentric white witch angela has been called in by the authorities to control groby temporal who has sent one citizen too many into limbo  into what groby himself calls darkness visible the feud between the two sorcerers families is of generations standing  ever since angelas greatgrandfather convicted grobys father of black magic and sentenced him to hang  but what is it in the children that groby instantly recognizes what power do they possess that he fears  groby temporal who fears nothing angela is intrigued is it that they are three children together or orphans or  as angela suggests  simply that they are so young they have time on their side  a sensitive issue for an erstwhile clockmaker whos overstayed his welcome by more than a century not one to pass up a possible advantage angela takes the kids with her when she goes to confront groby with him distracted she sends the kids into grobys shack to discover the secret weapon she can sense and from which he derives his power but groby catches them in the act  and although murray and ruth escape little dot is kidnapped and held hostage groby tells angela that unless she persuades the councilors that the beach rightfully belongs to him none of them will ever see dot again  time for a rescue by dint of stonethrowing windowbreaking and slingshotwielding ruth and murray manage to get dot out of the shack safe and sound  but groby switches his attention to murray himself  and sends him into darkness visible he swears murray is lost to them forever  and he and angela engage in a shapechanging battle to the death on the sands angela opens strongly but without the knowledge of grobys secret weapon she is slowly beaten down ruth and dot watching in anguish from further up the beach realize that to save not just murrays life but the whole town they must identify and dismantle the source of grobys strength ruth tears into the shack as she looks around desperately the four clocks that stand guard in each corner of the room begin to chime in perfect discord angelas time is up ruth realizes that the clocks are set at different times  what better metaphor for a clockmaker gone horribly to the bad frantically she resets the clocks so that they are chiming together harmoniously  and in the same way that angela is weakened by dissension groby temporal is by accord he falls powerless to his knees  to be banished forever by angela the time of temporal is over the beach once more belongs to everyone and the three orphans have found with angela dwelf a home worth fighting for they are orphans no longer
