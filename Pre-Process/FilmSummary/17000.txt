baby jake has lots of copying fun in a tropical adventure with sydney the monkey when baby jake spots a beautiful blue butterfly he copies its wing flapping action by flapping his arms next jake copies sydney and pretends to be a monkey whilst sydney copies jake and bumps on his bottom like a baby soon everyone joins in  the elephants copy the snakes and the snakes copy the butterflies until a magnificent formation dance takes place where all the creatures copy each other with perfect synchronicity
