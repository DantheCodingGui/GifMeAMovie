stan working as a custodian dressed in overalls stands in an empty room of the art gallery opening his tool kit he kneels by an open section of wall with a flashlight and begins tinkering with a pipe suddenly he is sprayed with a substantial quantity of water later stan works in the same spot mumbling curses to himself having discarded his wet clothes in the hall outside a patron walks with a visitors program and stops at a door with a sign reading contemporary art hearing the visitor stan panics and looks around the room when the patron enters she approaches an abstract sculpture that catches her eye placing her program on a table she is unaware of the presence of stan who is nowhere to be seen the patron looks at the sign beneath the art and it reads simply birth taking a last glance around the room the patron exits and stan promptly pops his head out of an opening in the sculpture out in the corridor the patron stops as she realizes shes left her program behind the patron returns to the contemporary art room to see stans head protruding from the sculpture and his shoulders squeezing their way out she stands there stonefaced as the naked stan strains to pull himself through the tight opening
