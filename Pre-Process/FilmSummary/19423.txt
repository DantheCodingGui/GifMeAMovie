barney has to go to egypt to film a travel programme and rather than leave nev on his own in the flat he agrees to mr pranks seemingly generous offer to move in and look after nev however there is an ulterior motive  barney has a widescreen television set and mr prank spends hours watching old episodes of star trek on it he is also very untidy and makes it clear that he will blame nev for making all the mess nev is at his wits end until crazy keith comes up with a solution  they will fly to egypt in a balloon to find barney
