when a member of the military sustains lifechanging injuries and a medical retirement is forced upon us we have often wondered do i still have it do i still have what it takes to be a soldier regardless of the injuries i have sustained this is where back to basic comes in back to basic answers the same question that men and women have tried to answer years after their glory days have passed can i get back some part of my youth through sheer force of will if any group of people can its former members of the military back to basic takes ten groups of three former military members with medical discharges for injuries sustained during combat and starts them at day zero of basic training and follows them all the way through as they are forced to reintegrate back into the military family there are multiple ways to make it through this competition if all three members of the group make it through together then the prize money is multiplied by three if only two members make it through then its only two times the prize money etc during each assessment phase of basic training there are three phases red white and blue if one member doesnt qualify during one of the multitudes of tests or phases and are recycled back to an earlier class then the whole group has a choice to make be recycled back with their partner or go forward without them the former service members get the chance to keep the teams they were initially assigned trade team members or go at it alone only one group of former service members or individual can win as in war there is no second place
