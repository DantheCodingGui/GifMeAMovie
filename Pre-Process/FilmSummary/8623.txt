mike gloria and archie take the subway back from the bronx where they were going to see a house archie warns them about the scum and preverts that ride the subway even though mike thinks dead wrong about the common man and about violence that theory is tested when they are witness to a feuding married couple who are not only at odds with one another but are determined to drag mike and gloria and archie into the middle of it the argument gets so heated that the man attempts to strangle his wife leading mike to jump to the rescue for a brief moment mike thinks he may have killed the man but he eventually comes around and despite the fact that the man is okay mike feels horrible for giving in to his base instincts
