gene siskel and roger ebert review four new movies they have a mild disagreement on sidney lumets scattershot power 1986 qv both agree this attack on media manipulation has weaknesses but siskel thinks richard geres energetic performance makes it worth recommending two enthusiastic thumbs up for paul mazurskys hilarious down and out in beverly hills 1986 qv they both laughed long and loud at this stinging but sweet satire about the collision of two disparate lives two even more enthusiastic thumbs up for hannah and her sisters 1986 qv siskel believes the movie ranks with woody allens best ebert says it is his best their thumbs take a sharp downturn for the best of times 1986 qv a weak football comedy with a bad robin williams performance
