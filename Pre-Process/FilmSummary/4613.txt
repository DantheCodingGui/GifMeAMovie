laura bradley and her two daughters jenny 10 and alison 13 are traveling in great excitement to their new home  the mysterious bradley house an unexpected inheritance from a greatuncle they never met but their taxi driver the surly alfie noakes is rather less than welcoming he tells them bradley house is wellknown in the neighborhood as haunted  and that nobody ever stays there long jenny loves bradley house from the moment she sees it she has a curious sense of being in her rightful home there alison just thinks its spooky laura thinks the house is probably and regrettably going to be far too expensive to maintain but jenny wants desperately to stay particularly when they uncover the fulllength portrait in the hall of jonathan bradley circa 1780 a sternfaced captain of the royal navy greatgreatgreatgreatuncle jonathan who vanished in sinister circumstances two hundred years before is he the famous ghost well at any rate hes family but does uncle jonathan want the modern day bradleys to stay from the moment of their arrival strange and alarming events seem to be conspiring to force them out shadows are halfglimpsed peering from windows a flowerpot falls from the roof and comes dangerously close to felling laura footsteps are heard moving around in the dead of night jenny is not one to be thrown off the scent of a good mystery by a little fright she is determined to track down the source of the footsteps whether it be ghostly or mortal  and accordingly she creeps back into the house when laura and alison are in town and discovers hiding in a locked room two stowaways  the cat bartholomew and the brave and resourceful tommy a little boy of about her own age who has run away from the orphans home he was placed in and until the bradleys arrival had been roughing it in the empty house tommy is afraid that jenny will tell laura about him and he will be sent back to the home  but jenny promises him she will not reveal his presence to anyone he can go on hiding just as before laura meanwhile has been seeking advice on the possibility and wisdom of a sale from the apparently kind and decent solicitor james pardoe  whose interest in the case seems to be partly motivated by his interest in laura alison too is adjusting rapidly to the new town on the steps of the library waiting for laura she meets a new friend and fellow budding intellectual  nigel hargreaves 13 laura comes home worried not only would the house be a monster to upgrade and maintain but pardoe feels that due to its reputation she is unlikely to make any money even from a sale  though he has managed to find an interested buyer for her at a depressingly low price  lauras worry turns to outright horror as all three bradleys are woken by terrifying noises in the night finally the chandelier crashes down right in front of where they are huddling together for safety and laura has had enough  she wants the girls to leave the house with her right now but of course jenny knows what the others do not  that tommy is also here and that if the place is really being haunted by a malevolent presence she cannot leave him behind despite alisons protestations she dashes back into the house  and is captured by the man faking these socalled hauntings the apparition turns out to be none other than their unfriendly taxi driver the ruffian alfie noakes but why is noakes so keen on forcing the bradleys to sell with poor tommy held as prisoner and hostage noakes gloatingly reveals all in fact the estate of bradley house is worth a fortune  particularly if the house could be torn down to make room for a new development  the unnamed buyer is noakes himself  together with his partner the deceptively sweet james pardoe noakes is out to make a mint but if jenny wants to see her friend alive again shed better hold her tongue  and make sure laura signs pardoes papers of sale tomorrowvery subdued jenny rejoins her angry mother and sister reluctant as she is to leave bradley house itself furious as she is to have her family cheated out of its rightful inheritance in this way it seems she has no choice but to go against all her own wishes and inclinations and try to persuade laura to go with pardoes duplicitous suggestion however alison has been suspicious of the lawyer from the start with nigels help she discovers the truth about the worth of bradley house despite jennys tearful pleas to leave well enough alone alison and nigel burst into the solicitors office just as laura is about to sign the papers  and spill the beans poor mr pardoe who had been driven to desperation by mounting debts confesses all but his contrition may have come too late for jenny who has raced back to bradley house to save tommy thwarted noakes turns nasty on both of them  especially when he receives a call from pardoe telling him the game is over hed best give himself up he seizes jenny  she will be his hostage to freedom at this desperate juncture the real ghost of bradley house enters  not bartholomew not tommy not noakes but uncle jonathan himself unhand my niece you knave  and noakes flees for his life so the immediate danger is averted but there still remains the problem of how the bradleys can afford to maintain their ancestral home nothing easier uncle jonathan tells jenny  and in one stroke their financial embarrassments and the twohundredyear old mystery of his disappearance are solved jonathan takes jenny to a secret room that no one else has ever known of and there sits uncle jonathans skeleton still in his naval uniform still with its hand poised over the chest of gold coins he had been in the midst of counting at the moment of his death
