mac and reed notice that malloys thoughts are elsewhere when told that adam12 is to report to summers department store on a reported shoplift reed soon learns its because the stores security investigator jane hayes is an old flame of malloys who he has not seen in a while jane is a police officer who works at the store on her days off they broke up a year earlier because malloy could not handle dating a policewoman there are feelings still between them despite she now being engaged to someone else the shoplifter who jane has in custody is nineteen year old heiress mliss courtnay mliss is a chronic shoplifter at the store the so far small items stolen which store management always placed on her fathers charge account after the theft this time the item was a little more substantial a diamond watch retailing at 2500 but not found on her person when arrested malloy and reeds investigation takes them to the courtnay home to see what her father and stepmother know about mliss activities her parents who deal with the situation in their own way malloy and reed end up believing mliss shoplifting has something to do with a new ageist cult to which it looks she is a member but something also happens to mliss along the way which adds an unwanted twist to the case
