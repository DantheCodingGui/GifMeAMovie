australian story accompanied mr fischer his wife judy and sons harrison and dominic as they travelled to the northern territory on the government jet for a flurry of final engagements with mr fischer filling in for john howard for the last time along the way the program recorded candid interviews not just with the fischers but also with tims sister vicki baudry and his brother tony fischer there are moments of relaxed family life interspersed with the never ending official round and there are flashes of the famous fischer idiosyncrasies around events such as the auctioning in darwin of one of his famous hats raising an all time world record price for an akubra the story provides fresh insights into the man who has been hailed as one of the few genuinely original characters on the australian political scene and yet according to mr fischer he is walking way seemingly with no regrets the story ends at sydney airport on sunday night july 25 when mr fischer hands his formal letter of resignation to prime minister john howard returning from overseas judy fischer however makes it clear she has never really adjusted to aspects of public life im looking forward to being out of the spotlight so much i cant tell you ive always found aspects of public life very very difficult tim seems to have been there long enough that hes become immune to a lot of it but i still find it very very hard having people pointing at you when youre sitting in a restaurant or people talking about you when you walk past i find all that sort of thing very difficult so that for me will be one of the greatest bonuses of this decision discussing son harrisons autism she says tim has been asked what he will say when harrison grows up and says well did you resign because of me and tim will say to him no i got a life back because of you and dominic and i think that is exactly how we see it our children are giving us a chance to have a better quality of life mrs fischer also relates another telling anecdote there were a number of incidents in the last few months with the children that i know affected tim very deeply one time hed come back from an overseas trip and the children hid behind the chairs tim said where are you and they said were scared daddy were scared and he got really hurt but it was perfectly natural with little children tims always larger than life he comes bounding in and i think he took it in a way they hadnt meant but i knew it affected him
