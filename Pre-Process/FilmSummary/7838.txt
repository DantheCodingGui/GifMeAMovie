the problem with being a notorious outlaw is everyone likes to pin every crime that crops up on you that includes lying embezzling murdering bankers which is fine if youre trying to become an infamous legend but a problem if youre hoping for a pardon for your past crimes so heyes and curry have to set things to right and theres nothing like a diamond field to get a crooked banker into a even bigger mess so he has to confess to avoid a noose isnt greed a wonderful thing
