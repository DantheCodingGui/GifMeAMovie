beavis and buttheads lives revolve around three simple things 1 barely attending school which sucks they do nothing they learn squat they know diddly they hate the teachers  and amazingly they manage to avoid being thrown out 2 trying to score with chicks  something we know theyll never achieve 3 watching tv lots of tv if something in the real world doesnt relate to what they know from tv it sucks they especially enjoy reviewing music videos  or just commenting inanely on them if a video contains heavy rock scantilyclad babes or antiauthority figures its cool  otherwise it sucks
