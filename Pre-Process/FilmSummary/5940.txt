a drug addict robs a store run by elderly women selling small items they make by sewing things such as pot holders and doilies they spot a convertible with three men just after they are reported on the radio to have held up a store a pursuit takes place and together with mac arrest the three men later a nearby antique shop is held up by someone with a similar description to the first robber he asked for a limited amount of money and a later call back to the first shop indicates he returned the money stolen earlier a car is spotted making a rolling stop at a stop sign but the driver is a priest looking for the police to arrest a man from whom he bought marijuana they accompany him back to the dealers apartment and make the arrest the final call is back to the first store where the same addict is in the midst of another robbery they capture him followed by malloy secretly buying some doilies after having teased reed for buying pot holders the previous day from the grandmothers malloy and reed attend to an armed robbery just occurred at a small craft store owned and operated by a group of elderly women who sell their own wares despite the modest viability of the store it gives the women a sense of purpose despite her advanced age the manager frieda pine has the faculties of a person half her age as she is able to provide an assessment of the situation accurately to malloy and reed a description of the perpetrator exactly what he was wearing and the fact that he was a drug addict albeit a kindly one the one aspect about which mrs pine is probably naive is that she believes the perpetrator will eventually return the 4375 he stole from them as he stated at a later armed robbery call at an antique store the owneroperator ted clover is not nearly as alert as mrs pine as the fact of a gun being waved in his face and that the perpetrator only wanted 115 of the 300 he had available made him not notice much about who held him up but what little he is able to remember makes malloy and reed believe it is the same perpetrator as the craft store hold up malloy and reed are certain the perpetrator will strike again in order to support his habit and hope they can catch him in the act in the end both reed and malloy show their affinity for the women although each would prefer the other and the rest of the world dont know on another case they luckily manage to come across a stolen vehicle just as its description is broadcast by the police dispatcher later they pull over a car on a minor traffic violation this pull over ends up being a little more complex one in drug dealing to youth
