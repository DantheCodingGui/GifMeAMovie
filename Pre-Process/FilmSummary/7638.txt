\nWhen R&B legend Marcus Hooks dies suddenly, VH-1 invites his original back up duo, Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds, "The Real Deal," to appear at a memorial tribute at the Apollo Theater. Floyd, who\'s bored in retirement, wants this more than anything; Louis, a philosophical ex-con, does not.

Floyd begs, Louis consents but won\'t fly, so they leave L.A. in Floyd\'s flashy Cadillac with five days to get to New York.
