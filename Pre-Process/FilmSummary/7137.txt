iago hoped for a commercial bonanza on agrabahs founders day but during the sultans celebration speech in memory of his bedouin ancestor hamed the citys founder a witch uses a magical hourglass to open a time portal trough which abis mal jumps without his faithful haroud to change the citys history putting his bloodline on the throne so aladdin and his gang jump after him hoping to cross the abysmal plan then as they always manage here and now jasmine motivates her ancestor hamed still a mere caravan merchant but abis his cameldriver abnor abis mal also brought the hourglass and has the sultantobe thrown trough another portal to the dinosaur age which makes jasmine disappear too this time only aladdin and genie get trough just in time and so on even crazier when the hourglass gets broken so various ages mix into a time continuum
