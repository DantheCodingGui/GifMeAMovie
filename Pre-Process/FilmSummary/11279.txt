karl is somewhat excited about his trip to petra jordan if only because of its association with the movie indiana jones and the last crusade 1989 qv although he does mention that he would rather live in a cave across from the palace rather than live in the palace to be able to see the beautiful instead of seeing the squalor from the beautiful his excitement is tempered when stephen and ricky suggest that since he is in the middle east that he take advantage of the situation by visiting israel as well this suggestion scares him because all news stories out of israel are generally grim karl is amazed by the dichotomy of religion which should be peaceful versus the presence of armed military everywhere ricky and stephen further surprise him with some training apropos to being in a war torn region of the world crossing the border into bethlehem which is in the palestinian side strengthens that dichotomy in his mind on his way to jordan karl stops off at the dead sea which he sees as somewhat of a refuge for himself the enjoyment he experiences floating in the water is marred by a telephone call from his friends and something else floating in the water once in jordan ricky and stephen have arranged for him a two day camel ride across the desert to get to petra instead of the faster drive once in petra which is all karl really wanted to see on this trip ricky and stephen further surprise him by fulfilling his stated wish karl in turn surprises ricky and stephen by his response after that experience
