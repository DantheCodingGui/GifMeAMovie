malloy and reed are busying tracking the exploits of the con artist johnson family making their annual pilgrimage through los angles ripping off people they involve false delivery of wood bogus roof repair and finally catching rattlesnakes for a couple of elderly sisters mixed in is the capture of a two men trying to burn a plant where one of them had been fired as a security guard for drinking on the job adam12 deals with a couple of traffic incidents one where a mans good intentions make a bad situation worse and another where a husband and wife have had a little too much booze for each to be able to drive they also attend to a burglar alarm at a business complex the burglars are somewhere in the dark utility basement which makes it more difficult to find them and determine the motive for the breakin but most of malloy and reeds shift is spent dealing with issues concerning the johnson family a band of swindlers who prey on the elderly their mo is to do odd jobs primarily in the realm of home renovations or provide home renovation type materials to unsuspecting clients who dont want dont need or didnt order such services or when they do require such services to do it in the quickest cheapest and shoddiest manner possible they hope to be able to catch the pair currently in action at someones home or spot their distinctive truck on the road
