there is a good deal of information on your ticket and it is always preferred that you print that ticket so that you have access to that info in your hands many people ask if they can simply show the ticket on their phone yes thats possible but some shows do not allow cellphones besides that if youre a little late you may find that you can not access the ticket on your phone so its a good idea to go ahead and print it off if you absolutely cant print it off dont worry we can look you up in our scanners using your id
