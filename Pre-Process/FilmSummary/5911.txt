on a saturday night they start with a man pulled over for a possible dui but he passes the sobriety tests when they noticed an oddly parked car they start to investigate but hear shouts from a nearby house followed by three gunshots they find the owner has killed his exsoninlaw who invaded his house after being released recently from jail a report of car strippers turns up a single man stripping a car a stopped speeder says he has forgotten his wallet and license but the car has over 900 of outstanding traffic tickets malloy pulls a bluff to force the man to give his real name the shift closes with two robberiesbeatings at motels on a saturday night patrol malloy and reed are primarily focused on what ends up being their 5 bet against each other reed has been in negotiation with a used car dealer on a vehicle they only being 25 apart on a several hundred dollar price the bet is whether the dealer will call back by the end of the day as reed believes he hanging tough will result in the dealer coming down that 25 with their actual work they deal with a potential drunk driver who swears he isnt next they spot an unusually parked vehicle which ultimately leads them to a domestic dispute of a deadly nature then on reeds urging they decide to swing by the dealership so that malloy can see the vehicle in question they end up seeing something of a totally different nature as they head to their next call next they pull over a speeding driver not trusting his story malloy and reed decide to pull a legal sting on him then they attend to a call at a motel where a robber exacts more damage than even he would probably admit was worth it at the end of the shift one of malloy or reed is 5 richer the other 5 poorer but not quite for the reason the poorer thought was going to be the case
