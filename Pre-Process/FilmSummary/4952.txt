\nBest friends Derek and Clif set out on a trip of lifetime. Their plan: travel to the ends of the earth, see the world, and live life to the fullest. But the trip soon takes a dark and bloody turn.

Now, thousands of miles from home, in a foreign land, they must race to uncover the source before it consumes him completely.
