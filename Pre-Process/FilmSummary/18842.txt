in a distant part of the galaxy lie the twelve colonies of man a civilization that has been at peace for some forty years with an empire of machines the cylons who were created generations before as worker drones for mankind but became independent rose in rebellion and launched war on their masters now the cylons have evolved into more human form into machinecreated biological beings who seek to exterminate true biological humans to this end they use a human scientist gaius to help one of their infiltrators known as 6 penetrate the colonies master defense mainframes gaius is reluctant but smitten by 6 a cylon woman of seemingly insatiable sexual desire and the result of their affair is a nuclear sneakattack that obliterates the colonies and the star navy deployed for their protection one ship however survives an obsolete battlestar known as the galactica scheduled for decommissioning the galactica instead must lead 50000 surviving humans on a quest for a new home world where they must bear children to rebuild their race first however the galactica must lead surviving ships of the colonies to a weapons deployment base within a spatial storm a rendezvous that leaves them trapped when two cylon base stars track them down and open fire there is some sadness and many farewells on the day that the battlestar galactica is to be decommissioned and turned into a museum commander william adama has the respect of his men and like the ship itself he too may be coming into the last years of his storied career they are all taken by surprise however when they are attacked by the cylons the first cylon war ended 40 years ago and there has been no contact between them and the people of the 12 colonies since the cylons are well prepared however managing to disable most of the 12 colonies computers before the attack adama orders his ship into action but the aging galactica is partly decommissioned and does not have the supplies and ammunition to put up much of a fight adamas son capt lee adama is also on board the battleship but they do not get along well since the death of lees brother meanwhile industrialist gaius baltar learns from his lover that she is in fact a new form of cylon humanlike in virtually every respect
