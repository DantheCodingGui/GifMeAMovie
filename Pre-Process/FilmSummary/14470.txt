the the show you want to attend is sold out that means we are no longer taking ticket request for that show if you are already on the waitlist for that show we will continue to process ticket request off the waitlist until the show reaches capacity so you may still receive tickets if you are not on the waitlist we suggest requesting tickets to another show thanks for your understanding
