karl isnt overly excited by his next trip it to drive along route 66 as he believes its general public mystique may be something manufactured by excitable americans he will drive the route west to east starting in santa monica california but not in the type of convertible he was hoping his first arranged stop he doesnt think will be a memorable one but it ends up being memorable as what he considers one of the most embarrassing situations ever in his life two of the next three stops will show karl that many manmade curiosities have popped up along the route those somewhat benign stops sandwich what ends up being an uncomfortable one where in a traditional hippie section of the route he participates in cuddle therapy next in a section of the route where the gold rush occurred he meets with a modern day prospector who has a few explosive offroad surprises for him he trades up his vehicle at the next stop for a truck named nasty boy by its owner he takes a 180 degree turn culturally when he lives the amish way in indiana feeling like karl may be bored of driving stephen and ricky arrange for karl to see the last part of the route by air from which he ends up having an interesting vantage point they may ultimately have to resort to plan b to finish the trip depending on what is the lesser of two evils for karl
