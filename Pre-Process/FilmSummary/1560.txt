1984 was a grim year for the san francisco giants the team finished dead last losing 96 games but no one  not the players not the front office not even the fans  had as nightmarish a time as wayne doba that season the 33yearold actor was selected to play the clubs first mascot the crazy crab was conceived as an anti mascot the giants wanted to satire the late 1970s mascot craze which had introduced nowiconic characters like the philly phanatic so the giants gave their crab an intentionally shabby foam costume which looked like a hamburger with arms during spring training tv ads showed manager frank robinson attempting to strangle the crab at games announcers would encourage fans to boo whenever the crab took the field it was an experiment unlike anything in professional sports doba became the andy kaufman of baseball he mooned the crowd he taunted his own players the concept worked  all too well fans did more than boo they pelted doba with everything from beer bottles and peanuts to golf balls batteries carrots and water balloons filled with human poop the crazy crabs career was shortlived the character was unceremoniously axed in 1985 but doba and his antimascot left such a lasting impression it would be 17 years before the giants would try introducing another mascot
