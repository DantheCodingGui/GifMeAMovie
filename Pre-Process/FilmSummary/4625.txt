the craig family have always taken their annual holidays at the beach in their quaint muchloved seaview cottage but this year things are poised to change for sarah 11 and her brothers peter 14 and jack 16 their father has lost his business and unless the children can come up with a solution they will lose the second home that has always meant so much to them peter and jack have long grown out of digging for buried treasure which is the only plan sarah can come up with for restoring the family fortunes sarah is used to being the butt of her older brothers jokes when she really does make a find she is not surprised that they wont pay her or it any attention but theres something very special about this particular piece of jetsam what sarah has unearthed is a silver salver  valuable in itself but far more importantly containing the spirit of james pierrepoint pirate pierrepoint wants sarah to find the key to release him from the fourhundredyearold curse that has kept him prisoner but the man who cast the curse originally is still very much around the infamous dr dee elizabethan alchemist and sorcerer is posing in the town as an antiquedealer he displays a sinister interest in both sarah and the salver  for dee he doesnt want this particular antique going anywhere  at first a frightening and ghoulish figure pierrepoint warms to sarah he twice saves members of her family from danger  her brothers from a rockslide her mother sylvia from a car accident  for as dr dee tells her things were a little muddled when the curse was made flashes of the future nods and whispers about the past as well four hundred years ago pierrepoint marooned a relative of dr dees on a desert island his punishment is to remain forever trapped in the salver condemned to a waking death of neverending cold and neverending fever  unless the curse can be lifted  but how can sarah find the key pierrepoint shows sarah one last vision a little boy hurt and lost when the search parties of the community fail to find him and she cannot convince her family of what she saw in the salver sarah sets out in desperation to consult with dr dee dee tells her the salver has one wish and one wish only for the person who finds it sarah is faced with a terrible choice she can use the wish to find the little boy she can save the cottage she and her brothers love so much by asking pierrepoint to tell her where the accumulated treasure of his career of piracy is hidden or she can set pierrepoint himself free if pierrepoint has used his flashes of the future to help sarah surely she has an obligation to do what she can to help him in return but the life of a child is at stake it is the final irony that in doing what dee had never expected her to do and using her one wish for someone other than herself  apparently dashing both her own and pierrepoints dearest hopes in the process  that sarah unwittingly unlocks the curse and sets pierrepoint free the key to the curse had always been an unselfish wish  and for four hundred years that one twist had been enough to keep pierrepoint prisoner weary but content sarah throws the salver back into the sea and turns to say goodbye for the last time to the irascible old pirate  but he has gone forever the only clue that he was ever there at all is what he has left her a torn ancient map  to buried treasure
