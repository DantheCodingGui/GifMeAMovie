karl isnt overly concerned about going to mexico beyond ricky and stephens assertion that it probably is the most dangerous place from a personal safety perspective than anywhere hes traveled thus far as he travels there during the easter season karl is exposed to two religious celebrations the first which recreates the crucifixion and resurrection of christ and the second which is on the surface less religious and which the authorities would like to shut down if only because of its explosive and thus potentially dangerous nature interspersed between these two stephen and ricky send karl into training for what has become a mexican cultural phenomenon professional wrestling he makes two stops on his way to the raison detre for the trip to mexico chichén itzá the first to experience the life of a churro a mexican cowboy and the second to spend some time with a mayan family who are descendants of the builders of chichén itzá the latter stop exposes him to more unusual food namely bee larvae he finally arrives at chichén itzá before dawn to beat the crowds and to watch the sunrise over the monument however karl can only focus on the issue of the dead heads associated with the place throughout his stay in mexico karl goes on a search for the mexico of his childhood and it is uncertain if he will be able to find it and he makes a surprising admission before he heads home
