for karls trip to egypt ricky and stephen believe its time for him to experience budget travel by flying economy and staying in the seediest of hotels about which karl is not too happy karls first experiences wandering the streets of cairo makes him wonder how anyone gets anything done as he is bombarded by street hawkers at every turn unlike his other travels karl ends up traveling almost immediately via camelback to see the main site the great pyramids due to their close proximity which ends up being underwhelming if only because of the weather as he waits for the weather to clear to make another attempt to see the pyramids karl is provided a guide achmed who gives him a lesson in bartering and takes him to the museum of egyptian antiquities in which karl has no interest so karl ditches his guide to find some comfort food which ends up also being an experience to which he is unaccustomed stephen and ricky then send him on a nile cruise which does not lift his spirits beyond doing something just to piss off ricky they also send him to visit a couple named andrew and seija who provide an alternative view of the pyramids karl then revisits the pyramids which he will not believe great if only because theyre old unless they are the oldest things on earth
