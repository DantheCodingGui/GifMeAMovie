tyson is so determined to beat the psykicks in an upcoming battle that hes ordered kenny to modify his dragoon beyond legal specifications but because his blade now has too much offensive power tyson is unable to control it and he becomes totally frustrated with himself and his blade the more he tries controlling it the worse he becomes his friends try to tell him cheating isnt the way to win yet tyson ignores them and being pigheaded as he is he goes off to sulk about his dilemma meanwhile the psykicks are with doctor b who informs them that he just wants to do some last minute finishing touches on their cyber bit beasts both kane and salima protest saying they feel they are more important as players than any stupid cyber bit beast is but once they go into battle and feel the raw cyber power they are immediately hooked and want more while this is going on tyson wants to get back to training just as ozuma walks up he has come to teach our hero a lesson that its not about the blade its about the player and the lesson finally sinks in when ozuma destroys dragoon
