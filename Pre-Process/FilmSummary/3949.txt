mike has proposed and laura accepted but it all seems rather an anticlimax and laura is not exactly bursting with enthusiasm when her parents arrive to make plans for the wedding to top it all mike has been gazumped on the house he wanted to buy them  and laura characteristically has disappeared fortunately mike knows where to find her and how to say it with flowers to ensure that they will be happy ever after
