jamie irving 12 loves and admires his father  but the two of them are worlds apart rick  tough smart perfectionist and very determined  has a glamorous and dangerous job as an investigator working for customs he is the quintessential man of action and does not understand how to deal with his gentle intellectual son jamie feels misunderstood and constantly put down by rick when he cannot handle effectively the bullying a timid boy of his age is often subjected to he feels his father despises him but rick is about to find out that there are times when discretion is certainly the better part of valor he has stumbled onto information that he may have to pay for with his life the smooth and debonair alex trent  a big time businessman with powerful government contacts  is dealing in nuclear arms the next shipment is due at any moment it is a case with frightening international ramifications and the last person rick should have chosen to confide in is his boss for marsh is working for trent himself  and rick is taken hostage interrogated and then thrown into the harbor more dead than alive it seems incredible to jamie that his largerthanlife father could be vulnerable in any way  but an even bigger shock is in store for him for rick appears to him as he plays in the garden and tells jamie he desperately needs his help but how can this be when rick is lying comatose in intensive care  ricks spirit has dissociated from his body and jamie is the only one who can see him it may be the first time jamie has had his fathers undivided attention in his life rick and jamies first attempts to alert the police to what has really happened to rick and what he risked his life to defeat are foiled at every turn rick knows he will need hard evidence to convince anyone of what seems an outrageously farfetched scenario  that a highly respected businessman and a senior inspector are working together to supply arms to terrorists during his interrogation he had noticed surveillance cameras all through trents hideaway recording the every move of its inhabitants perhaps his own security measures could be turned against the villainous trent  if rick and jamie could only get the tape showing trent giving the order to have rick killed to the police  but between ricks impatience and jamies timidity none of their carefullylaid plans come to fruition the turncoat marsh  who is still presenting the plausible face of the caring boss to the world  is like jamies mother jean puzzled by jamies peculiar behavior and the fantasies he is having about what happened to his father  but unlike jean marsh knows how close these socalled fantasies come to the truth and time is running out rick for the first time understands he will not be able to achieve his object without figuring out a way to work as a team with his son both sets of unique and specialized skills  jamies quick mind and technical expertise ricks strength decisiveness and courage  must play a part if their plan is to succeed jamie  guided and directed by rick  manages to infiltrate trents center of operations and acquire the incriminating tape he is immediately pursued  but rick cannot stay with him his time is up  if his spirit does not go return to his body he will probably die jamie bravely insists his father leave him to fight the rest of the battle alone in demanding respect for his own strengths jamie discovers he is braver and more resourceful than he knew  and in that he is truly his fathers son
