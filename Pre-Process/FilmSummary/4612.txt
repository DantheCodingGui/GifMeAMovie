the johnsons live in a small country town their dairy farm has been in the family for three generations and although in recent years they have been struggling mike  the father of david 13 and katie 10  is not about to let it go without a fight david has his own worries  he is being bullied at school by wayne brogan 14 the son of a rich neighboring farmer wayne is particularly scornful of davids pushbike which is no match for waynes own allsinging alldancing version on the day our story begins wayne chases david home from school knocking him into a ditch and badly damaging the bike mike is as suspicious of pat brogan as david is of his son for some years now pat has been offering to buy up the johnsons farm the chief moneyspinner of the farm is their specialist cheeses with the bank threatening to foreclose despite the best efforts of the familys accountant larry sharpe there could not be a worse time for the persistent and mystifying spoiling of the product mike is not beyond believing pat brogan to be somehow behind the contamination  and nicky 19 the johnsons attractive dairy assistant doesnt like him very much either the night of davids crash there is a huge thunderstorm over the farm david cowers under the sheets  and therefore misses the most spectacular effect of the lightning  until he wakes the next morning  the morning of friday the 13th  to find a girl in his room he has never seen before  insisting that he is trespassing in her room jem johnson  from the year 2098 jems father back in the future has designed a compucator  what jem calls a commie the commie is an astonishing invention a kind of handheld intuitive supercomputer which works by accessing the users alpha waves and the universal matrix the 21st centurys version of the internet jem has the prototype and was being chased by a couple of what she calls badlanders for it when she crawled into her closet to come out in davids time jem is charming brave quick witted  and impulsive after a number of nearmisses with davids bewildered family and unable to get back to her own time she finally takes matters into her own hands and introduces herself to mary the childrens mother katie davids sister is very keen on jem particularly when jem reveals a fantastic common skill of the future telepathy for which katie displays a definite flair strangest of all when jem takes herself to school she makes a surprising conquest  wayne brogan the only thing that worries responsible david are the two sinister men who seem to take as keen an interest in jem as wayne does david is suspicious of waynes sudden transformation into sir galahad and slightly jealous as well when jems commie goes missing from her locker he suspects wayne has stolen it despite waynes indignant denial  and when jem goes missing next hes certain of it he and mike have an angry confrontation with pat and wayne but at midnight jem is still not back unable to sleep with worry david is startled by the appearance of katie in his bedroom the telepathy game the children played has had an unexpected outcome katie is receiving persistent images she is sure are from jem  images of an office a filing cabinet a night street seen through a window the children slip out of the house with only their dog bones for company and set off to the rescue they are joined by an unexpected friend and ally  the erstwhile bully wayne jems images lead the children to the main street of their little town and into the offices of  larry sharpe but what can the familys sympathetic accountant have to do with the kidnapping of jem as katie and bones keep watch outside wayne and david begin the difficult task of breaking into larrys inner office where jem is bound and gagged katie is horrified by the appearance of larry and  of all people  nicky the johnsons dairy hand what on earth are these two doing together leaping to her feet katie cannons into the fire exit door through which the children broke in  and to her horror it slams shut locking her out and the two boys in there follows a tense scene with wayne and david in precarious hiding  but eavesdropping can sometimes be illuminating it becomes clear not only that larry and nicky are behind the kidnap and the theft of the commie but that they have long been in collusion over the jeopardizing of the farms produce  the accidental spoiling of the cheeses  in order to force a sale  and force the johnsons out with the appearance of the two men david has observed watching jem the dastardly quadrangle is complete larry pays off the kidnappers and he and nicky leave gloating with not only the farm but the secrets of the commie in their grasp they will be very rich villains indeed katie and bones sneak into the building as david and wayne free jem with her telepathic powers she unlocks the combination dial of the safe and regains her commie  and david makes a very important discovery documents that clearly implicate larry in the fraudulent handling of the business affairs of the farm the childrens gleeful laughter merges with the rumble of an approaching thunder storm  and we open again on david asleep  and his calendar clearly showing friday the 13th as mary shakes him awake david stumbles downstairs bewildered jem is nowhere to be seen and his inquiry about her meets with a blank response from mary but mike and mary certainly have enough to be distracted by  the morning mail brings the precious contract from pacific dairy products they have been waiting for and the paper the shocking news of the arrests of larry sharpe and nicky david is lost in thought as the joyous dance of his parents mirrors the joyous dance of he and jem the night before  and katie enters bearing a puzzling object the commie which she has just found in davids room david can only smile at her it is something he has dreamed up dreamed up for the future
