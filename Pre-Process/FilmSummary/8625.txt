mikes graduation is coming up fast and he is stressed about his final exams everyone is stressed except archie who couldnt be happier because graduation would mean that he and gloria would move out and he would finally get to convert their bedroom into a den as a celebration he buys a pipe and sweater and even starts trying to find a place for the goat head that barney hefner gave him but his joy is undercut when mike tells him that he has excepted a fellowship and is going to stay on at school for another year
