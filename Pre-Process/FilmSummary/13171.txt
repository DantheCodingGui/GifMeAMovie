its mrsslocombs birthday and the staff decide to pull together and buy her a gift but missbrahms remembers that last year mrsslocomb said she was as old as her cat then 49 so the staff assume that this year she will turn 50 because of this it is decided that the occasion calls for something extra special so a professional birthday cake made by a friend of mrhumphries and a proper chorus of happy birthday to you is prepared but what will the staff do when they realize that they dont even know mrsslocombs first name
