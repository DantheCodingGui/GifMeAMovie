rickys suggestion of the next bucket list item to do  meeting the endangered mountain gorilla in its natural habitat  does impress karl if only because of their likeness to humans ricky states they are 98 genetically identical to humans although the gorillas karl will meet are located in uganda stephen and ricky think karl should see other parts of the subsaharan african continent while hes there anyway they first send him to south africa to help with a charity advising local children and rebuilding huts which ends up unnerving him primarily because he requires a security guard on his stay while karls there stephen and ricky encourage him to partake in an activity which he didnt do on a previous trip karl then drives to a residence the owners who have a hippo as a pet that has access to the inside of the house next he visits with the ndebele tribe where he will learn their painting techniques while he cooks a meal for their king he is next sent to take part is a major wildlife conservation project where a wild male rhino is being relocated for the survival of the local females finally arriving in uganda karl is first tasked with purchasing secondhand clothes to wear for his gorilla meeting the actual meeting which is not quite as karl expects but which he still takes away profound realizations of life
