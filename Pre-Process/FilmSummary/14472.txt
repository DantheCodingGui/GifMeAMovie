the waitlist is the 1iota ticketing queue we open up ticket requests and in most cases everyone who requests a ticket is simply joining the waitlist when we can we will begin making tickets available to those in the waitlist these available emails will go out in batches and ticket will be reserved on a firstcome firstserved basis also our agents do not have the ability to see where you are in the waitlist so they can not tell you whenif your tickets may become available
