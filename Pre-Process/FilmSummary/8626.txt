archie is outraged when mike brings it upon himself to invite a friend to stay the night worse is that the friend is paul who archie remembers as a nice cleancut kid with dreams of being an engineer but is now an aimless hippie with long hair archie gets on his moral highhorse when he finds out that paul has brought along his girlfriend robin and plans to sleep with her on the bunkers couch even though they arent married when pauls friend jeff shows up to pick him up jeff is not happy that paul has brought robin along because his father would have the same hang up about their unmarried status as archie jeff breaks the deal and leaves leaving paul and robin to sleep on the bunkers couch as planned
