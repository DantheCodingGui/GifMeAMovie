recent archaeological discoveries reveal a very different picture of what life on earth looked like in the remote past it was a reallife version of lord of the rings where humans shared the planet with various different types of intelligent humanlike species such as neanderthals denisovans and even hobbits but how is it that these various hominid species developed separately in isolated pockets of the globe and why does no fossil evidence exist suggesting a slow gradual delineation from a common species ancient astronaut theorists suggest these different intelligent species seem to have come straight out of the incubator and that earth itself may have served as an extraterrestrial laboratory a laboratory where different human prototypes once existedbut only one species was chosen to survive is mankind the result of an extraterrestrial experiment
