all the animals in the savannah are bored especially herbert out of frustration the warthog kicks a small rock it makes a pleasing sound herbert tries to tap different sized rocks slowly building up a rhythmical pattern music has been invented zed the zebra joins in shaking two gourds aardvark uses his long snout as a trumpet the musical trio ask reginald the lion if he wants to join in too but reginald is not interested he wants to be left alone while he is doing a nap herbert zed and aardvark move a bit further away and resume their practice session however reginald can still hear them and gets very annoyed the animals move further and further away until they reach the old volcano the next day a concert is planned in the crater of the volcano animals have come from far and wide when the band starts playing a row of weaver birds flying over the volcano pick up the catchy tune they are still whistling the tune when they pass near reginald now the lion is really cross he marches to the volcano and roars in protest rrrroaaarr but instead of frightening the animals reginalds roar has the opposite effect it seems to fit in perfectly with the music the audience goes wild for reginald now the lion has no choice but to join in the concert a great success
