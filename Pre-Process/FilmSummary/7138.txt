while aladdin and carpet flew higher then ever abu and iago made such a mess in the palace that jasmine and aladdin nearly persuaded the sultan to throw them out of the palace then fairies arrive who busily show a magical mess is even worse only it takes a while til people realize their mischief is not the gangs work they prove wellmeaning but infantile as playful and tireless as puppies but magical fliers who can give aladdin and the amused royals skyrides making carpet feel superfluous while iagos attempt to make abu feast with tablemanners goes wrong in no time alas the fairies wont accept the humans get tired and want to return instead they lift the whole palace so you must never leave and trick genie into a knot unable to stop it crashing down when the fairies leave because their playmates refuse to keep frolicking only carpet tries to save them smashing to smithereens inside the falling palace
