archie and mike are alone in the bar cleaning up everyone has gone home and edith and gloria are away on vacation with little joey while moving things into the storeroom mike closes the door behind him with the key on the outside  the only way out trapped for the night mike and archie down a bottle of booze while covered with a tarp left over from kelcys days as the booze soak in they begin to talk mostly about why archie is so prejudice against people who are different mike is stunned when archie reveals not only taunting from his classmates over the fact that he had to wear one shoe and one boot thus giving them the nickname shoobootie but that his father was a very abusive man who corrected archie by hitting him and locking him in the closet for days at a time yet archie defends his father nonetheless finally archie passes out on the floor and mike who is still stunned covers him with the tarp and wishes shoobootie a good night
