malloy and reed attend to a couple of domestic dispute calls the first has the wife mad at her husband for wanting to watch a football game on television it isnt so much watching the game itself but with who he wants to watch it the second domestic dispute involves a husband who escaped from a mental institution and now has his wife hostage at knifepoint threatening to kill her inbetween they attend to a possible jumper from a third story window when they reach the window they find the mans purpose on the ledge is a little less deadly than wanting to jump but is nonetheless potentially as dangerous but malloy and reeds time over several shifts is attending to vehicle arsons often set by lighting flammable materials in garbage cans they often arrive on the scene while the fires are still ablaze but the arsonist long gone whenever there have been witnesses they have not been totally helpful malloy and reed just hope that they or another unit can catch him in the act before he kills someone or before others get similar ideas
