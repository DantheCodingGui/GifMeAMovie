heather and especially sarah are perturbed that someone has been continually doing the number two in the womens restroom but not flushing sarah who does almost anything required to find out the culprit while heather seemingly will do anything figures that it is someone with anger issues so she goes on a search for the angriest woman in the office while steve does his own somewhat creepy surveillance sarah thinks that brad may know something more about it than he is letting on meanwhile chelsea has instituted the nope board at the office on which she hangs what she considers offending pieces of clothing that her staff wears among the items confiscated and posted on the board are steves running shoes which results in him exposing his infected toes and johnnys selection of shirts one of which he was planning on wearing to a small intimate party to which he has been invited by chelsea to jennifer aniston qvs house heather hates the nope board if only because chelsea buys the person nice clothing in replacement so heather figures that fashion conscious people like her are left out in the cold and brad and chris convince a nervously excited johnny that he may have a chance of getting intimate with jennifer at the party
