david morgan 12 is a natural scientist he is already obsessed with what is destined to become his lifework the design and construction of a time travel machine what david affectionately refers to as the tasmo  time and space modulator but the path of a boy genius in a small and conventional town can be thorny davids father alan would rather see him out on the playing field with a baseball than in the annals of history to add insult to injury david is failing all his subjects except science and even his teacher the bookish spinster miss jameson is beginning to lose faith that the tasmo will ever work  a mysterious newcomer to alverton seems to know and understand more about david his work and his problems than anyone else what does the middle aged balding and paunchy donald wells have to do with young davids life when alans shop is broken into and the prototype tasmo stolen donald seems the obvious suspect but donald wells is from the future  hes been sent to ensure david does get the tasmo back because without it the development of time travel is impossible he meets david accidentally in the park and drops a clue as to the true identity of the thief that david can barely credit in his groundbreaking work on the tasmo david has miscalculated more than the chronology determinator dowdy miss jameson is not  or not simply  the altruistic mentor she seems while essentially goodhearted she has fallen desperately in love with the school headmaster the cold and manipulative eamonn dodds and at his urging has entered into a moneymaking scheme to get them out of alverton forever  together the tasmo is a hairsbreadth away from actually working  and the plan is to steal it from david and sell it to the highest bidder so david and donald join forces if miss jameson has stolen the tasmo then david must steal it back he and donald creep into the school in the dead of the night together  but the burglary goes badly wrong when david makes a shocking discovery that donald knows so much about him and his tensions with his father not because he was exceptionally well briefed but because he is david  as david will be in 2035  this isnt the future as david imagined it  and if rescuing the tasmo means that david will grow into the balding and overweight donald then its time to change the course of history david runs away leaving donald behind to be caught in the school grounds and arrested for breaking and entering  but not before he has hidden the tasmo donald has had a pointed conversation or two with alan too  and when alan realizes that david has abruptly lost all interest in time travel and turned overnight into a superjock wannabe he is more anxious than gratified david refuses to discuss his change of heart leaving his father very worried  when he sees david being shepherded into the headmasters car and driven away his concern turns to fear dodds is of course frantic to find the tasmo again  but his interrogation of david is of no use david doesnt know where it is either and at this stage couldnt care less miss jameson who has been becoming more and more uneasy about the part she has played in the skulduggery is shocked and disgusted by dodds bullying of who is after all her favorite pupil alan bursts in at the critical moment  and duplicitous dodds draws a gun on all three of them but alan remains resolute under fire he tells david he must do what he wants with his life not what alan or dodds or miss jameson want  dodds sneers but he would have done better to have kept alert the moment she sees he is distracted miss jameson creeps up behind her erstwhile suitor and knocks him unconscious with a vase as dodds falls the vase shatters  and there in the shards lies the tasmo davids historic invention  and his future
