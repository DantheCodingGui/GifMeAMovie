every year on 5th may the family of caroline anderson gather to remember her sudden unnecessary death they do this not in sombre hues or with mournful hymns but with the children laughing and balloons flying heavenward on the balloons are letters to their mum hi mum i hope you are happy in heaven im in the soccer team now australian story follows the appalling events that lead a healthy new mother from the birth of her healthy third child to death by neglect in a period of a few weeks the anderson family whose members include pharmacists nurses and lawyers would seem to be among the least likely candidates to suffer from a breakdown in the health system but as the coroner said at carolines inquest she fell through the cracks however the andersons were not just personally devastated by the loss they felt a responsibility to attempt to salvage something positive from the tragedy they began a long and difficult journey to attempt to change the system so that others wouldnt suffer the same fate as caroline having secured a full coronial inquest into carolines death the family then had to wait 12 months for the health care complaints committee to make its recommendations
