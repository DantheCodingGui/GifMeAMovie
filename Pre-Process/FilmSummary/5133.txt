\nNolan Mack is sixty. Married to Joy, a charming and intelligent woman, friend to Winston, a bright literature professor, and well-regarded in the bank where he works, Noland leads a quiet uneventful life. But is he happy, as his superior at the bank once asks him...? One night, as he drives back home, he nearly runs into a gay hooker. Sorry for what might have happened, Nolan starts a conversation with the young man named Leo and ends up in a hotel room. Not for paid sex as Leo expects though. In fact, the polished old man has fallen in love with the raw prostitute. For, having been gay since the age of twelve, Nolan has never been able to express his sexual orientation and Leo happens to crystallize all his feelings and desires. But is a hooker the ideal object of a romantic love? And to what extent will it affect his married life and professional career?                ',
