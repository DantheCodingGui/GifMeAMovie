the bladebreakers are stranded on the barren russian tundra after their runin with the demolition boys when the majestics mysteriously show up in their bus after picking our heroes up they stop at an abandoned palace where robert challenges tyson to battle at first it seems strange that robert would do this but tyson accepts and a battle ensues with tyson losing two straight he becomes infuriated robert then tells tyson that he must harness his power back into his blade which totally confuses tyson finally kenny tells tyson to remember a battle he had against robert back in his castle thats where tyson realized he must work together with his bit beast with this knowledge a third battle takes place and tyson defeats robert but the question still remained why did the majestics want to challenge our heroes to a battle for no apparent reason in the end it turns out mr dickenson set this whole lesson up to get the bladebreakers ready for the final match with the demolition boys without accessing their power from within the bladebreakers wouldnt stand a chance against the demolition boys in the finals at the world championships
