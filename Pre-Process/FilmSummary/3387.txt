\nEve is waiting backstage to meet her "idol" aging Broadway Star, Margo Channing. It all seems innocent enough as Eve explains that she has seen Margo in EVERY performance of the current play she is in. Only Playright critic DeWitt sees through Eve\'s evil plan, which is to take her parts and fiance. When the fiance shows no interest, she tries for Celeste Holmes husband and playwright. But, DeWitt (George Brandt) stops her. After she accepts her award, she decides to skip the after-party and goes to her room, where we find a young woman named Phoebe, who snuck into her room and fell asleep. This is where the "Circle of Life" now comes to fruition as Eve is going to get played the way she did Margo.
