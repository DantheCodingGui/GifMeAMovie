this time on american pickers danielle has asked for a raise but the guys think its more fun to torture her instead of giving her an answer they uncover a few choice items while visiting a kentucky biker couple and visit a serious collector who is definitely in the mood to sell they also explore a former honkytonk turned home complete with a stage and sprawling toy collection their eventual haul includes a vintage steampowered corn popper and massive laurel and hardy heads now the only thing left for the guys is to meet and discuss the raise
