young steve morgan seems almost happy that hes been arrested and taken to jail now maybe the guys at the pool hall will take him seriously he just hopes that when his stickup hits the papers it doesnt come out that he used a toy gun his cellmate much older and much more experienced warns him against being too cocky jail is serious and the next days lineup will prove it the kid doesnt pay attention but it wont be long before steve morgans flippant remarks begin to catch in his throat
