this is a show for the internet its an absurd reflection of the way you live when your not online  without being preoccupied with social media if we have to get all academic about it the show is a satirical examination of cocooning culture and the mutilation of social gooditude  ie shutins and the wonderful world of spending too much time inside conceptually the show is muppets in the modern age we dont mean brightly coloured singing things in a modern setting what were talking about is the answer to the question what if the concept was invented today by independent filmmakers the series itself draws from the aesthetic of the muppets the format of strongbad emails and the premise of alf while borrowing from the comedic tone of regular show the simpsons and south park  among several dozen other inspirational movies tv shows and comics that noone in our core target demographic has heard of or remembers which will make you think our ideas are fresh and original
