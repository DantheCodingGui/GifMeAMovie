before shift officer ed wells impresses all the new officers including reed with stories of his ignorealldanger style of police work the senior officers including malloy are not impressed or happy wells ignores malloys desire to safely handle a man with a gun and hostage and instead busts in taking the suspect whose gun shot misses wells reed is impressed with wells while mac chews malloy out for not handling his own calls a call about a man taking a boy turns out to be a father trying to take his son to the barber malloy and reed backup wells on a call about a man with a shotgun wells rushes the house but is downed with a load of buckshot malloy and reed use their car to shield them as they rescue wells they visit wells in the hospital and reed has learned another lesson reed is among the large number of younger impressionable officers who are awed by the arrest stories of officer ed wells who always gets his man and who seems to be the hero in the process malloy however is less than enthralled with wells whose style endangers himself and all those around him even after wells unit attends a call assigned to adam12 and wells rushes into the situation without a full assessment reed still sees wells as a superman especially as he did end up diffusing the potentially violent situation but that call irks malloy even more since wells ends up being the arresting officer while the call was supposed to be adam12s leaving mac to wonder why malloy wasnt doing his job even at their next call  that of a suspected child abduction andor molestation  reed doesnt quite see that wells style of policing may have had disastrous results if he had attended that call the question becomes whether reed and wells will realize that wells is a danger to society before he a fellow officer or some innocent bystander gets injured or worse killed because of his actions
