mr weems is supposedly near death some of his lodge brothers have invested in a cemetery and are in needs of customers they make a bargain with weems they will pay weems fifty dollars a week for the rest of his presumably short life if he agrees to buy the first plot they hope that others following mr weemss lead will also buy plots unfortunately the men discover that weems is a bit more resilient than any of them thought the knights of the golden lodge are not having much luck selling cemetery plots in fact theyre having no luck at all not a single plot in elysium parks has been sold brother brown suggests that no one wants to buy a plot before the first person is buried there then brown brings up clarence weems an inactive member who is very ill just waiting to die in fact brown suggests they convince weems to allow himself to be buried in their cemetery in return theyll pay him 50 a week for as long as he lives it all sounds like a good idea and mr weems agrees to it but as the title of this evenings teleplay suggests mr weems is not going away as quickly as his lodge brothers had hoped
