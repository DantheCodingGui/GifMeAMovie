reed starts the day with filing a report on being conned out of 30000 by a door to door salesman who modifies a 3000 check reed gives him officer ed wells gives reed a hard time about being too trusting which is further embellished when reed buys a day old newspaper from a young boy on the street they are faced with a fight by two men over a marijuana plant it is followed by a woman running to a bank for a 1000 ransom for her young baby being held by a mentally unstable and armed man finally they are called to a home where a hysterical woman tells them a man in a light colored shirt shot at her reed and wells catch a man fitting the description in the backyard but the man says he is innocent reed wants to see if the woman can identify him but wells takes him to the station under arrest after the woman calmed down she told mally the man who shot at her was her drunk husband who shows up again threatening her and reed wells is then faced with a chewing out by sgt macdonald for making the false arrest giving reed some revenge and smiles prior to roll call reed is missing from the locker room and is seen at the report desk despite he and malloy having submitted all their necessary reports at the end of their last shift the officers learn the reason is that reed has been the victim of theft he being swindled out of 270 from a person he trusted this ironic twist of fate is fodder for officer wells who wont stop from ribbing reed about being too naive to be a good police officer reed who quietly seethes at wells criticisms nonetheless hopes he never gets as cynical as wells on patrol malloy and reed stop a frantic looking woman who is distressed but wont divulge her problem after they see that she is heading to the bank which has just closed she finally breaks down and tells them her problem her brother who has just escaped from a mental hospital is holding her infant son hostage at her house for 1000 in return he threatening to kill the boy otherwise as other officers get involved they have to approach the house carefully especially as they have no lines of sight inside since all the curtains are drawn they have to choose what they deem the best of several options to get both out of the house without incident next they are called to a house where there were reports of shots fired they attend to the scene with adam43 which includes wells the frightened latina woman inside the house reported that a hispanic man in beige pants was the shooter when reed and wells find such a man outside reed believes the seemingly scared mans story of his innocence whereas wells believes reed is once again being naive further information from the woman inside will show if reed or wells view on policing is correct this time
