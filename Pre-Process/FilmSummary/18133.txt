a man who works for an insurance company is killed when a guy attacks him and throws him down an elevator the police think its an accident but the mans wife doesnt think so so she hires barnaby to investigate what they dont is that the man was providing a group of thieves with info on various clients so they can rob them and the man who killed him is the leader who just got out of prison it seems that the man was getting together with the leaders girl whos also a member of the gang and theres dissension in the gang when the leader insists on restoring the usual way they divide the take which means a great portion goes to him but one of the gang thinks theyve been doing all the work since hes been away and done well which means they deserve a greater share
