our heroes land in egypt for the next leg of the tournament where the first two teams going up against each other are the blitzkrieg boys against the barthez battalion but as barthez readies his team we learn hes devised a special spider weblike tape that is supposed to shoot out of his teams blades and trap their opponents in an inescapable web miguel is torn and knows that if they follow his coachs plan they could win but he feels hed rather lose with respect than cheat in the first battle aaron goes up against tala barthez tells his players to just act natural and he would operate the spider webbing by remote control as the battle begins barthez desperately pushes the remote control but nothing happens turns out aaron refused to use the fixed blade barthez is furious miguel is defiant and tell barthez that they arent going to be his puppets anymore as barthez leaves miguel steps into the ring against kai the battle doesnt last very long as kai wins handily but miguel has lost with dignity and thats just the way he wants it
