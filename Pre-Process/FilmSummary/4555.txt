frosts efforts to join a gym and date julie the fitness instructor are hampered by two suspicious deaths the first concerns a man found dead on a waste tip with no identity beyond an empty wallet seemingly a mugging victim however his wife comes to report his disappearance and frost in following through is intrigued to learn that her sleep therapist is rather more than just the concerned friend he professes to be could these two meek little souls be capable of murder the other body is that of escort girl heather found in a hotel room booked by married businessman stephen richman he denies murder but confesses that he was shocked to realize what she did as she was a student friend of his daughter later he is found dead in his car but frost can see no reason for his suicide and rightly so the escort agency is involved in bringing in eastern european girls to work as pole dancers and heathers desire to join in the profits of the enterprise may just have caused her death frost eventually solves both cases and can at last relax with julie with a university fasttrack policeman dc tranter assigned to him di jack frost has two murders to deal with the first is that of a man later identified as joe hawkins who is found at the local tip it has all of the appearance of a mugging but oddly his wallet is still in his back pocket his underwear is also on backwards with his identity confirmed when his wife dianne reports him missing she says that her husband had a big win at the track and had a good deal of cash on him the night he disappeared frost cant help but wonder if mrs hawkins had a hand in his death the meek and mild woman simply doesnt seem the type however the second death is that of heather wills an attractive young woman who is found dead in a hotel bedroom from all appearances she was on the game but the man who acknowledges seeing her there stephen richford denies anything to do with her death in fact the girl is a close friend of his own daughter and he claims he was there to retrieve money he had lent her to go to university frost believes him and focuses on the escort agency that employed her as the owners may also be running a people smuggling ring
