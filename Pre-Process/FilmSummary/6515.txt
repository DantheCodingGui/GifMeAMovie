jimmy is unenthusiastic when diana puts alex forward for a scholarship to a private schoolcausing her to accuse him of indifference to his sons future  as well as being unmanly so he buys a motorbike to appear macho unfortunately its a kiddies model but it comes in handy at getting him through a traffic jam to wish alex good luck  even if it reduces his status with biker stella
