col gallaghers plane is shot down and he parachutes into switzerland as a neutral party in the war the swiss are obligated to intern gallagher for the duration but he has important information about a vital target and so american agents direct him to the french resistance to get him to the english channel to safety however his escape is complicated by the tagalong of the daughter of one of his contacts who has been shot by the nazis and a german deserter trying to evade being executed by his own troops or by the french who still see him as the enemy the question now is whether the underground can deliver gallagher and whether he can trust everyone who seems to be on his side
