new recruits arrive at the 918th and one of them a young gunner with a stellar training record cpl steve corbett is chafing at the bit to get into combat so he can kill some krauts on his first training mission however he panics when his gun jams and sgt komansky steps in to settle him down and teach him the ropes which pleases col gallagher because it is the first time komansky has shown anything but a me first attitude unfortunately corbetts actions become even more erratic in subsequent missions leading to the unearthing of a secret that may embarrass the army air corps if it becomes general knowledge and all of this on the eve of a particularly tricky mission on which corbett could be a major asset
