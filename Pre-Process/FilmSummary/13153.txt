tate loves to gamble and always accepts any challenge given to him unlike alex who never does even when the odds are in his favor but he may have put too much at stake when he accepts to play any game at clicks emporium with the owner if tate wins hell get free passage for a year but if he loses mr click will get his thumbprint what tate doesnt know is that losing means he will be owned by mr click who doesnt need an excuse to do something harsh to a cocky gambler who insults him since he shrinks his victims to sell as pets
