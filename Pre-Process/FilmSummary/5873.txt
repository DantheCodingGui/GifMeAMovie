reed volunteers to find entertainment for the department party but he is having poor luck and his options left are poor they spot tj an informant who tells them about a possible drug house they spot a woman and girl at the same bus stop an hour apart when they stop to talk to her she tries to run they learn she is from new mexico looking for her husband but doesnt know how to contact him and has no money she stole but did not open a box of cookies the officers take her to the salvation army that night they locate the drug house and call in support they arrest five people but it takes a detailed search to find the drug stash in a shower drain reed successfully asks a well known country singer to perform when they serve him with a subpoena reed is a hit with most of the officers malloy and reed run into their snitch teejay who tells them of a drug den upon informing narcotics as well as their own sergeants of this information they who are not totally convinced seeing as to the source of the information malloy and reed are allowed to investigate later in the evening as long as it doesnt interfere with their regular patrol that patrol includes seeing a young woman with a child who seem to be in some sort of trouble they learn the lengths a desperate and scared mother will do to feed her child when they later check out the purported drug den they find that teejays information is correct the problem may be to find the stash of drugs to charge the dealer jimmy eisley with more than a minor infraction but its the last call of the night that worries reed the most it is to deliver a subpoena to renowned folk singer randy tait its not the delivery of the subpoena that scares reed but the question malloy is pressuring reed to ask him
