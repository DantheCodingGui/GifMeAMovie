mr prank is the only person to turn up for the auditions of barneys pantomime ali baba and the forty thieves so there is no option but to give him the role of the fortieth thief even though he is a terrible actor and has trouble remembering his lines crazy keith on the other hand actually does mistake him for a real thief when he overhears him going through his lines and calls the police to arrest him
