in 1928 bertie milton won the godolphin cup on a horse trained by his grandfather sir jasper  the only amateur jockey ever to win the race the victory was celebrated at the famous annual milton house fancy dress ball but the consequences of this particular party could not have been foreseen by anyone a tragic accident leaves bertie a reluctant ghost  a ghost who cant bring himself to scare the living and one who has yet to master the simplest skills of the afterlife  dematerialization for instance or how to walk through walls unfortunately for bertie his haunting is being overseen and critiqued by a very tough taskmaster mr pym the ultimate spectral bureaucrat and bertie has been assigned a most specific task no one who is not part of the milton family must be allowed to stay in the rambling old milton hall  which since the milton line has entirely died out is kind of a tall order  and does not bode well in 1998 for the rhodes family  david paula and their two children kate and john david is a writer he and his agent the excitable hugh are in the final stages of negotiation of the sale of the screen rights to his latest novel perhaps rather precipitately david has bought the milton mansion against the vast profits he and hugh confidently expect to flow in when the deal goes through  but will it paula has some doubts but kate and john dont care they fall in love with milton hall on sight and the resident ghost becomes equally rapidly fond of them it turns out that david has a connection to the place even paula was unaware of when a young woman his grandmother worked as a servant there and told david so many exciting and colorful stories of the house that as a child he used to dream about it for david coming to milton hall for the first time has an eerie sense of coming home he hangs a portrait of his grandmother in the main hall and settles down to prepare for his final meeting with the film company al wicks the fasttalking and very overbearing american producer interested in the project comes to dinner but due largely to berties playful antics leaves in a fury telling david he has just blown the best deal hell ever see david is himself so angry at the changes al was intending to make to his precious story he hardly cares but how will the rhodes family stay in milton hall without the sale of the book several moneymaking schemes are cooked up between bertie and the children but all are foiled by mr pym and an unexpected ally driven to distraction by his charges hapless good humor mr pym has summoned the man who brought bertie up if anyone can bring the undisciplined spook into line it is his authoritarian grandfather sir jasper but alas for mr pym  sir jasper has secrets of his own he is startled to find hanging in his old home the portrait of davids grandmother  a young woman he was once very much in love with in the second chance of the century sir jasper and davids grandmother meet again  and the best marriages are made in heaven so the rhodes family becomes part of the miltons and are permitted to stay sir jasper now throws his redoubtable energies into securing their fortune he and his ghostly bride choose to take their honeymoon in the malibu mansion of al wicks and prove very persuasive al relents davids deal is made and the family settles into what in a strange twist of fate has become their ancestral home
