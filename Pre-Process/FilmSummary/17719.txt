father peter clifford can handle the bruised ribs when he tries out as spare keeper in the local ball game celtic football but is unsettled when a young woman turns up from his manchester parish to visit expecting to continue their special relationship actually the bishops motive for his transfer to ireland meanwhile he wont stand by idly except in a critical spot as brian quigleys men poor manure over the site where edso and his wife and baby parked their caravan as part of a repair contract which turns out to be only half of the story the ball game proves both useful and worrisome in surprising ways the towns gossipmongers are working overtime when a pretty young woman jenny clark arrives in ballykissangel looking for father clifford its apparent that shes smitten with him and that theyve known each other since before he took his final vows she still dreams of a relationship of some sort but the priest has difficulty convincing her otherwise when she spends the night at the rectory he has to find accommodation elsewhere father clifford has another challenge when a young couple with a newborn babe park their caravan on brian quigleys land hes taken to spreading manure as a means of getting them to leave but clifford intervenes when the doctor tells him quigleys tactics may be injurious to the babys health lastly the good father finds himself as the backup goal keeper for the town football team
