mac has a problem malloys landlady who is a feisty little old lady had her purse stolen by a red headed boy she refuses to leave the station until her case is solved while on patrol they spot a car that seems to be acting strange when malloy circles around on it the car rabbits and the two men are arrested after a car chase for reckless driving and heroin found in the car at the station mrs obrien is hounding the detectives malloy after studying a rash of similar thefts suggests using a decoy to test his theory he believes they are stealing womens social security checks when they leave the post office a patrol call takes them to a house where a woman has reported that her husband has killed their son with a shovel reid notices tire tracks and wads of paper at the scene as they arrest the husband malloy and reid are called back to the station to handle a picket line created by mrs obrien and her friends while there mac talks to reid about the murder and reid realizes the candy wrappers and tire tracks belonged to the two men they picked up earlier next day mac allows malloy and reid along with a police woman to try the decoy idea resulting in the arrest of the red headed boy and cracking the rest of the ring elderly mrs obrien who lives in malloys apartment building is admired by malloy and reed for being feisty that feistiness causes a problem for mac and detective sanchez as she was a victim of a purse snatching by an unknown red headed young man malloy filed a police report but she feels mac and sanchez the detective on the case are doing nothing to retrieve her personal property and thus vows not to leave the police station until she gets some satisfaction on the matter mac deflects her back onto malloy whenever possible which is not always possible as adam12 still has their regular patrol regardless malloy and reed believe the path of least resistance may be to place extra effort to find the perpetrator of her purse snatching malloy has a plausible theory on the case which would require a redeployment of police manpower the question becomes whether mac losing that manpower to work on the case with no guarantee of success or continuing to be pestered by mrs obrien is the lesser of two evils on other calls adam12 is in pursuit of a vehicle for what was a minor traffic infraction they may only find out why the vehicle wouldnt stop if they can corner it and they attend to a distraught mother who believes her just killed son was killed by his drunken father as malloy and reed do their initial scan for evidence the answer may not be a clear cut as it seems on the surface
