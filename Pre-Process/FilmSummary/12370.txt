the cookbook ratio is unlike any other cookbook anna and kristina have ever tested and is really more than a cookbook although recipes are included what it does provide are basic ratios that one can use to develop ones own variations on recipes for example if one knows the ratio of fat to flour to sugar in a cookie recipe that ratio knowledge can be the basis for so many other cookies as such in the three hours they have on cook day they will be preparing three recipes directly from the book chicken sausages with basil and roasted peppers lemon tart and sponge cake with basic ganache and three additional recipes based on the ratios provided of the previous three dishes duck sausages with apples and chestnuts spinach panchetta and garlic tart and coffee  walnut sponge cake their guest taster is david robertson xxxi qv an executive chef and cooking instructor who knows his cooking ratios anna and kristina know that chef david will further critique them on presentation as he is also a food stylist which may be a little intimidating as the book contains few photographs of the finished products as the ratios have no preconceived end product anna and kristina will have to wade through what reads like a textbook to impress chef david who suggests treating additional ingredients as one often treats salt to taste anna and kristina also have issue with techniques and knowing appropriate flavor combinations in addition they taste test different types of fat to use in cookies which they will translate into the making of their tart crusts and they discuss measuring tools essential in the kitchen
