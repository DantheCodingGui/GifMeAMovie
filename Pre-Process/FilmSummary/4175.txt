in 1633 charles i stuart a catholic at heart turned his belated royal entry in scotland into a disaster by imposing a more lavish anglican style on its native staunchly austere protestant presbyterian kirk church its the prelude to a series of bitter at times bloody conflicts key events include the 1638 the national covenant the 1640 war the 1642 scottish part in the english civil war similar religious strife occurred in the reigns of charles ii james ii open catholics in continental exile and the protestant challenger the dutch usurper william of orange consort of queen mary charles i came to scotland for the first time in 1633 for his coronation he had been king for 8 years but the scots refused to send the scottish crown jewels to london so he had little choice but to travel there he was ignorant of the presbyterian church and grace was not his strong point as he decided the coronation ceremony would be anglican using an english priest riots resulted from the kings attempt to introduce an anglican prayer book for the scots scots published the covenant which demanded a monarchy governed by a constitution and subject to the law charles wanted to go to war but parliament wanted the same restrictions the scots were demanding and the english civil war began charles i was executed on january 30 1649 and parliament abolished the monarchy the scots declared his son charles as their king however and the war continued by 1660 charles ii was declared king of england and soon after of scotland the covenant of 1643 was declared unlawful but protests continued with a large faction rejecting the new king when james ii and vii ascended to the throne catholicism gained a new standing william of orange had his own plans however
