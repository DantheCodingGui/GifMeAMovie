kookie and jeff shoot it out in the office at 77 but its just a prank on jr that night en route to a case in a remote cali town kookies mistakenly arrested for rape he figures a call to jr will straighten it out but the car hopoperative thinks hes being punked again so jr tells the local sheriff to lock kookie up and throw away the key the rapist hijacked kookies wheels and made him switch clothes so the sheriff has good reason to suspect the young pi the whole towns inflamed over the assault so kookie may not even make it to trial
