the referee has been unable to manage a game properly the crowd starts to boo at him for being useless at taking command of the game very distressed he takes out his uniform as he feels he doesnt deserve to wear it any more the dynamics are ready to give him a hand they believe the referee is suffering from a severe lack of selfesteem and that he needs to recover is usual self confidence hooper has an idea they will play a training game however this training session wont be addressed to the players but to encourage the referee
