in a new attempt to try and sink the oppositions morale charlie asks mike sarcastically how he can accept the fact that linda studies at university when this obviously will mean his girlfriend will be much more intelligent than him this makes mike think as he doesnt want everyone thinking of him as a soft touch and least of all he doesnt want linda to think he is stupid therefore mike decides to study and goes to the university foreseeing possible problems hooper offers to go with him together they are in unknown territory where a couple of students insolent 1 and insolent 2 will treat them as if they where weirdoes however at the end hooper and mike will earn their respect on the court of the universitys sport centre
