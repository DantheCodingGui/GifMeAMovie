the video begins with a moving song which tells us that our hands are the lords hands and asks for his help for living in peace with our neighbors suddenly we are in a room with jesus and his disciples he tells them that many people have desired salvation in a corner of the room two men are in deep discussion one of them a lawyer challenges jesus to tell him what is to be done to inherit eternal life jesus tells the story of a man who needed to travel a dangerous road to jericho to buy spices we are transported by jesus words to a wayside inn the innkeepers young son overhears two robbers plotting to steal from people on the road the scene shifts to the home of jewish spice merchant his wife worries about his trip to jericho but he must make the journey so he bids his family farewell on a isolated mountainous road the two robbers hide among the rocks soon the spice merchant comes into view the robbers steal his gold and leave him for dead on the deserted road not long after this a priest finds the abused man he expresses regret saying that if he were not on the lords business he would stop and help him next a levite finds the dying man but he is only concerned with his own safety and runs to avoid the robbers then a samaritan tells the innkeepers son i just did what anyone would do he leaves money for the injured mans care watching all this the young boy knows that the samaritan is truly the good neighbor to his fellow man
