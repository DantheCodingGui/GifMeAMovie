no you dont have tickets let me try to explain  we send out available notices in batches lets say we have 100 seats available well send out notices to 125 people why because some folks arent going to take them some will however and those tickets are reserved on a firstcome first serve basis so if you receive an email that says you have tickets available it is in your best interest to login asap to reserve them otherwise they could get snatched up before you login sold out shows occasionally have space open up 48 hours before the event due to ticket holders canceling last minute you would then be able to reserve your tickets we do not send email notifications to you if other members decline their tickets so be sure to check back to see if space has opened up for you to confirm your tickets
