theres a big secret at grace brothers apparently the store might be taken over by a competitor to discuss the matter a board room meeting has been organized convinced that the new company will give them all the boot the staff are quick to search for new jobs but then the staff are informed that there is a chance that grace brothers can be saved if enough shareholders go against the takeover unfortunately the four shareholders whos vote would save grace bros arent able to attend the meeting so in a effort to save the store and their jobs the staff volunteer to act as the shareholders and veto the takeover
