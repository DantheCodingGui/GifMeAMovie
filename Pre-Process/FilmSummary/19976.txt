the mark on tatsumis arm goes back to its small size much to the chagrin of hildegarde who destroys his games console she brings a play room for baby beel to play in but upon building it it turns out to be a magical cage that both she and tatsumi get stuck inside the only way to get out is to have baby beel solve a block puzzle toy but he just ends up breaking it frustrated tatsumi utilizes his zebel power to punch his way out though it makes his mark grow big again rummaging through a bag of demon world toys baby beel opens a chest that transforms tatsumi and takayuki into nurses which can only be reversed by helping baby beel play doctor tatsumi decides to use the opportunity to try to do good deeds and get rid of his mark though has trouble handling the demonic medical supplies after some failed attempts at treating some of the students they change back after discovering an actually useful tool on babt beels costume but accidentally triggers an explosive that negates all the work tatsumi did getting his mark down to size
