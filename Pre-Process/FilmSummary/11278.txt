upon karls arrival in delhi his senses are overwhelmed and not in a good way which is not helped by his sleeping arrangements he trusts on day two of his trip he will feel better if only because things cant get worse he is scheduled for an eight hour overnight bus ride to the kumbh mela festival the largest religious festival in the world which he is not looking forward to since he is not a religious person and doesnt understand the attraction of religion but the day ends up being a colorful one in an unexpected way which in part is the reason for him not feeling too well as if the festival was not enough his next stop is to visit with a living saint in his ashram for some spiritual guidance next he is sent to a cow sanctuary where he comes up close and personal with many aspects of the sacred animal including its famous patties and finally he goes to agra to visit the taj mahal which he believes was built out of guilt
