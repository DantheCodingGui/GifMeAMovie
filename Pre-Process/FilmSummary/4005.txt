this episode of a french guy named saba was planned since episode 2 but saba took forever to take the courage to do it the song single ladies is very difficult to sing and the choreography forget about it but saba did it for our amusement yes the intro was filmed in florence italy and celebrates all the single ladies with the gorgeous statue of david and the great fontana del porcellino
