in this episode we look at how entertainment from circuses and vaudeville to plays and movies influenced the common words and phrases we say every day how did bad actors give us the word explode rude actors give us the phrase to upstage someone and superstitious actors give us break a leg how did the circus give us words like jumbo and siamese twins and the idea that politicians jump on the bandwagon why did vaudeville invent deadpan humor slapstick comedy and off color jokes and how did the movies give us expression like cut to the chase and cliffhanger
