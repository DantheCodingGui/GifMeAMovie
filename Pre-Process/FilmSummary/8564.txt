archie is happy with the news that an old high school buddy bummy is coming by for dinner but is less thrilled that he is bringing his wife dolores whom archie had a brief encounter with while he and edith were dating fearful that edith will find out he is a nervous wreck all through dinner alone in the kitchen edith reveals that she knows about the whole thing but dolores had forgotten all about it before they leave dolores and archie have a moment and she pretends that she remembers everything edith tells archie that she knew about the whole thing and that there are no hard feelings yet she leaves a minor suspicion in his mind that edith wasnt as innocent as he might have thought
