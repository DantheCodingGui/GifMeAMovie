adama is dying after boomers attack but dr cottle is on another ship the rising star the arrival of a cylon basestar however forces the fleet to make an emergency jump suddenly galactica is alone the fleet had old coordinates and jumped elsewhere the only way to find out where they went is to jump back to the basestar gaeta thinks of a dangerous plan back on caprica starbuck doesnt seem to like boomer helo has a lot of trouble preventing her from killing the bearer of his child boomer is forced to flee on kobol things are getting precarious the cylons are getting close and the away team has to run forgetting a medical kit with serisone the seriously injured socinus needs colonel tigh finds himself in command not only of the glactica but of the entire fleet as commander adama lies severely injured in the infirmary and president roslin is in the brig with the unexpected arrival of the cylons tigh orders the fleet to jump to its next location only to have the galactica arrive alone apparently having forgotten to provide updated jump information to rest of the fleet that finds itself in a different location the only solution is to go back to where they jumped from and calculate where the fleet is most likely to be  an undertaking that is time consuming and dangerous given the presence of the cylons there is a way to shorten the time they will need but it involves doing something that the commander would never approve on kobol some of the survivors have to return to the crash site to retrieve a medical kit on cylonoccupied caprica starbuck is ready to kill boomer now that she realizes she is a cylon only helo stands between the two of them forcing boomer to take action
