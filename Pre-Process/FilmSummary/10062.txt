tonight mr dizzy and dr danger are both booked to perform in front of thousands of fans at charlotte motor speedways dirt track this is the first time that danger and dizzy have shared a bill and theyve been fighting like cats and dogs since they got here its a giant track but it aint big enough for the two of em as showtime approaches the tension between dizzy and danger grows and the question is can they get out of each others way long enough to hit their marks for dizzy its all about collecting another world record and for danger 22 years of struggle all comes down to this
