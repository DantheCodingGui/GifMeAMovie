as is usually the case theres a lot on di jack frosts plate these days hes been assigned a new officer ds terence reid who has been transferred somewhat abruptly after investigating a university student for selling contraband cigarettes he has other problems as well as frost soon learns but generally he is a good copper their first case is that of a woman eventually identified as sylvia carter whose remains are found on the railroad tracks after being run over by several trains she worked for a local sandwich maker and frost is convinced she was having an affair with someone dr helena gibson a senior surgeon at the local hospital in denton goes missing over a weekend from all accounts she was in on saturday but didnt show up at a colleagues house for lunch on sunday she was brilliant in her field but was disliked by virtually everyone at the hospital so there is no shortage of possible suspects if in fact anything is amiss lastly jack has a lookalike who is impersonating him and then touching and groping women he is not amused nor is supt mullett who is worried about appearances
