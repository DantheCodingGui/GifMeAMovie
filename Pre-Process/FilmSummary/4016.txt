a french guy named saba is celebrating life barbara and laigle noir is a french classic that saba used to sing at every party during his last two years of university it is with great humility that he is performing this song for his old time friend cristelle and her beautiful family when saba was young he was bullied by his stepmother for over 13 years between the age of 9 and 12 all he wanted was to end the torture he attempted suicide 3 times saba didnt know who to talk to what to say and what to ask if you suffer talk to someone you trust talk to us this song is about a black eagle coming out of nowhere and seducing you to surrender your life never give up
