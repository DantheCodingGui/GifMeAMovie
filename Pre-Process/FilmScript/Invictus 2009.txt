FOCUS FOCUS Let why don\'t we do a little work while we watch we have a lot of promises to keep yes we do It\'s not too late if the boys can pick up their game if they don\'t heads will roll c\'mon you bloody bastards where do you want to go first for foreign investment? where the money is. America, England... Saudi Arabia How long before the world cup? about a year now is time enough for improvement Mr. President don\'t get your hopes up we\'re a damn disgrace did you see all those old aparthied flicks? they\'re a disgrace but it\'s also the constitution along with the aparthied anthem, I know But it\'s time people moved on look at this all of the whites are cheering for the Springboks all of the blacks are cheering for England I used to do that on the island we would cheer for anyone but the \'boks it made the wardens very angry of course it did sorry I\'m late, how\'s it going? very badly maybe it\'s just as well why? I\'ve just been at a meeting of the national sports executive there\'s a strong support to drop the Springbok emblem and colors if they play badly maybe it\'s a good time to make a change this could be the last time we have to look at the green and gold Francois\' team came to the stadium this afternoon unprepared and arrogant They left 80 minutes with their tales between their legs like whipped mongorels and I for one, am glad not because they lost but because there is now no way to ignore the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared To re-enter the world of top-notch international rugby The Rugby World Cup is now less than a year away and I for one am relieved that we are the host nation and there for qualify automatically for the tournament somebody gets the axe because I\'m not sure we can get in on merit alone who\'s it gonna be? team played without discipline Without strategy And without courage and there for... he\'s trying to get them to drop me he\'s just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played Maybe But people listen to what he says They brought shame upon our nation and I for one can say without fear of contradiction that today, these 15 so called, men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold Here\'s your tea, Mr. Mandela I warmed the milk tonight ahh, you are too good to me Mary your daughter called to cancel her visit this weekend Did she say why? No, she didn\'t she said to tell you she was sorry I see do you need anything else tonight? ahh, no Mary thank you, I\'ll go to bed good evening good evening Mary some nice pants for you God bless you there you go there you go God bless you you\'re a very lucky boy it\'s a real Springbok practice jersey I know it\'s a bit big, but it\'s warm and it will last forever c\'mon, take it, it\'s yours why won\'t he take it? if he wears it, the others will beat him up because the Springboks are so bad? no because for them, Springboks still represent aparthied and now, for the next item on our agenda the embassy executive proposes a vote on the following motion that, as a permanent symbol of the aparthied era The colors emblem and the name of Springboks Be eliminated immediately and that all sports teams representing South Africa shall be known, as the Proteos Comrades, we will submit this motion to a hand vote and in the event of a close count will go to a written ballot all of those in favor of eliminating the Springboks Raise your hands Viva Proteos Viva Viva both units to their cars, right now what do I tell the Japanese trade delegation? I delegate that decision to you do you want me to inform the VP? No we should at least include the minister of sport No I strongly advise against doing this, especially on your own it gives the impression of autocratic leadership you risk alienating your cabinet and your party your advice is duley noted Dear Mandela, the people want this they hate the Springboks, they don\'t want to be represented by them yes I know, but in this instance, the people are wrong and as their leader, it is my job to show them that you are risking your political capitol you\'re risking your future as our leader the day I am afraid to do that, is the day I am no longer fit to lead at least, risk it for something more important than rugby tell the boys I want to go very fast we, the executives would like to applaud you for your diligence and your courage please, join us in our anthem Comrades, comrades members of the choir, we would only interupt such beautiful music For something truly important Please, welcome, President Mandela Thank-you Thank-you I thank you, please Smile Brothers sisters Comrades I am here because I believe you have made a decision with insufficient information and foresight I am aware of your earlier vote I am aware that it was, unanimous none the less, I believe we should restore the Springboks Restore their name their emblem, and their colors, Immediately let me tell you why on Rogha lsland In prison all of my jailers were Afrikaners For 27 years I studied them I learned their language Read their books their poetry I had to know my enemy before I could prevail against him and we did prevail, did we not? all of us here we prevailed Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner they are our fellow South Africans Our partners in democracy and they treasure Springbok Rugby if we take that away, we lose them we prove that we are what they feared we would be We have to be better than that We have to surprise them With compassion With restraint And generosity I know, all of the things they denied us but this is no time to celebrate petty revenge this is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us even if that brick comes wrapped in green and gold you elected me your leader let me lead you now Who is with me on this? Who is with me? a luxury we only needed one more yes than no what if you hadn\'t got it? Well you know that is the parties decision Sorry Mandela but we\'ve got problems everywhere we look Housing, food, jobs, crime our currency you can\'t keep interupting affairs of state to placate a minority I must, that minority Still controls the police, the army And the economy if we lose them, we cannot address the other issues so, this rugby Is it just a political calculation? It is a human calculation if we take away, what they cherish The Springboks Their national anthem we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us I will do what I must to end that cycle or it will destroy us this tastes like shit man it\'s not the beer take another everybody take one I\'d like to propose a toast to the taste of defeat drink it remember this and promise yourself, never to taste it again You\'re right, it tastes like shit here\'s the schedule for the overseas trip (speaking Afrikans) What did he just say? he asked when we were supposed to sleep as well as other basic human functions If Mandela could do it we can do it in a common struggle that has brought about our emancipation and pushed back the frontier Of racism the millions of our people say thank you and thank you again I come here with a message people of the United States of America open your markets to us and come invest in our country and in Japan, President Mandela met with Japanese officials as he concluded a grueling trip to the far east and in related news, it was announced that Mandela will visit South Africa stop it old man It\'s cold man - Good morning Mandela - How are you? - Well thank you sir - Good morning sir How is your family Hendrick? top shape sir, how about yours?

He\'s not a saint, he\'s a man with a man\'s problems, he doesn\'t need us reminding him of them Good morning Mandela. - Good morning Thank you very much. - Enjoy it Very good Very good ahh Brenda, good morning Good morning Mandela I like that dress Thank you This is for you What is it? Your pay checks you haven\'t been collecting them what\'s wrong? This is terrible It\'s what deClerk got plus an increase for inflation Today President Mandela announced, that in his opinion his salary is too high He\'s right, they\'re all overpaid he has decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity give me the houses and cars they give him and I\'ll donate a third to charity too Hello hang on a minute please yes, of course they\'re lining their pockets as fast as they can must be his girl friend eh Oh, he knows I\'ll bloody well kill him what?

Francois Penaar call him in I will No autographs, OK? I know how to do my job, OK? Who is Francois Penaar? you can\'t be serious, he\'s the captain of the Springboks I like soccer myself you know what they say about soccer it\'s a gentlemans game, played by hooligans On the other hand Rugby is a hooligans game, played by gentlemen ya ya ya, I\'ve heard that one before And it wasn\'t funny the first time Can I ask you a question lieutenant? yeah, of course what\'s he like? when I worked for the previous president, it was my job to be invisible This president, when he found out I liked english toffee he brought me some back from his visit in England to him, no one\'s invisible That\'s where you wait One of his assistants will come for you and the bathroom\'s over there if you need it uh, OK, thanks What are our chances in the world cup?

I have a trading business Captain of the Springboks a very difficult job well not compared to yours, Mr. President well, no one is trying to tear my head off while I\'m doing mine Yes sir tell me Francois What is your philosophy on leadership How do you inspire your team to do their best? by example, I\'ve always thought to lead by example sir well that is right that is exactly right but how to get them to be better than they think they can be That is very difficult I find inspiration perhaps how do we inspire ourselves to greatness When nothing less will do? how do we inspire everyone around us? I sometimes think it is by using the work of others on Robben lsland When things got very bad I found inspiration in a poem a poem? a Victorian poem just words but they helped me to stand, when all I wanted to do was to lie down But you didn\'t come to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense No, please, Mr. President it makes complete sense to me On the day of a big match Say, a test In the bus, on the way to the stadium Nobody talks ah yes, they are all preparing right but when I think we\'re ready I have the bus driver put a song something I\'ve chosen, one we all know and we listen to the words together and it helps I remember when I was invited to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona Everyone in the stadium greeted me with a song at the time, the future Our future seemed very bleak But to hear that song And the voices of people all over our planet made me proud to be South African it inspired me to come home and do better It allowed me to expect more of myself may I ask, what was the song sir? Well, it was Ozisikilili Africa a very inspiring song We need inspiration Francois Because in order to build our nation we must all exceed our own expectations so what\'s he like? he\'s not like anyone I\'ve ever met before what did he want? what did he talk about? Francois, it\'s like talking to a brick wall what did he say? I think he wants us to win the World Cup Excuse me What do you think? it doesn\'t matter what I think Yes, it does I think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house I don\'t like seeing you shake his hand And I\'m not the only one you criticise without understanding you seek only to address your own personal feelings That is selfish thinking it does not serve the nation wait please here Give this to your mother for me please What is it? It\'s a bracelet I found unpacking why don\'t you just throw it away? I don\'t have the right, doesn\'t belong to me if she left it, she meant to throw it away "Mrs. said you finished with the paper ya, of course Here we go The World Cup is played every 4 years each playing in 90 foreign venues around the country each pool to the quarterfinals Ivory Coast qualifies that\'s wonderful According to the experts, we\'ll reach the quarter finals and no further According to the experts you and I should still be in jail you make a personal appearance in the finals and at the opening match between Australia and Springboks the finals will be broadcast to over a billion people around the world live A billion people watching us?

Are we some sort of circus act now? they expect us to play our best give our bloody all, then they add to our bloody work load What do you think about this Chester? well, I try not to think, cause it interferes with my rugby See? Talk to the Captain you gotta make them understand that don\'t have the time for this I\'m not going to talk to them Why not? we\'ve become more than just a rugby team and we might as well get used to it this is you speaking? Or Mandela? you know me better than that you know times change and we need to change as well Shit ya glad I don\'t live here don\'t forget, we\'ve got cameras on us at all times what a bloody joke CHESTER CHESTER CHESTER Chester, I reckon you\'re up what am I supposed to do? what you do best lets roll Who wants to play Rugby?

You hit another player when the ref isn\'t looking No, no, no The first rule of Rugby It can only pass the ball backwards or sideways do we practice today? yeah Form a line Have fun, pasalo Hands up like this like this I\'m here so I make it like this Now you run so I want you in groups of 3, OK? And in addition to the nationwide RP campaign We propose that that all retail outlets charge a fee for plastic bags ahh, excuse me Mr. Minister if you\'ll forgive me this sounds excellent, we\'ll return to it please indulge me for one moment while soccer is usually their favorite sport here... But things changed today When a group of local kids reall took to the Springboks in a surprise visit... See that? That picture is worth any number of speeches this is Johan Revelius Reporting live from Cape Town airport Where the Sprinboks\' flight has just landed the green and gold have just one week to put the finishing touches to their grueling training program And I for one, must admit to being cautiosly optimistic I say cautiosly because in my humble opinion The Springbok team has been over practised on the field, and over committed off it which makes beating a bower house Austrailian side in next weeks opener a tall order Especially as this is an inexperienced team with a history of coming up short in big matches This is Live in Cape Town returning you to the studio in Johannesburg around the world objectively What are they saying about our chances to beat Australia? Everyone thinks they\'ll beat us And if they do we will have to go through England and the rest just to get to the final so, it is very important that we beat Australia? Thank-you Mandela, the cabinet ministers are here to brief you on the trip to Taiwan Yes, I\'ll be right out one week boys want snipers on top of the stadium and the surrounding buildings here No problem want those 2 approaches completely sanitized he comes in at the last moment We want uniforms plain clothes sharp shooters And sniffer dogs And if you need more men, we have an army unit on standby we are not going to take chances gentlemen The President is going to be exposed much too exposed Brenda I have been studying for the summit in Taiwan? good ahh, no, not exactly test me look like... block out their names, see if I can recognize them Andre Joviur Kevin Johnson did I get them right? yes Mandela that\'s the way I used to study in law school Unfortunately Chester is far too easy to identify But that will change it must team meeting, after dinner gather round what\'s this Francois, homework? make sure everyone has got one What is this? We need to learn this song we can\'t just mouth the words anymore nobody cares, as long as we\'re winning the matches you\'re wrong, they do care it\'s their bloody song, not ours flippin\' terrorist song they used to arrest you for singing it now it\'s one of our anthems I can\'t even read it or pronounce the words It\'s optional, take it if you want to It means, God bless Africa which, you have to admit, we could use Tell us, Mr. President Have you always been a rugby fan? ahh, people don\'t realize that I played rugby myself when I was a student it\'s a very rough game, almost as rough as politics How do you think the Springboks will do? I think they will do very well Their level of commitment is tremendous now it\'s been said, you used to support any team that played against the \'boks yes, well obviously that is no longer true I am 100 % behind our boys After all, if I can not change when circumstances demand it How can I expect others to? Francois Welcome, Mr. President Gentlemen, forgive me for interupting your work the day before such an important match but I just wanted to come and wish good luck in person Sometimes, very seldom, as president I\'m allowed to do what I want Mr. President, this is...

What happened? simple exhaustion, but it will lead to worse if it\'s not treated he needs a complete rest and I don\'t mean simply shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom No phone calls, no meetings, no visitors, no politics you know him, he won\'t do that then I\'m going to put him into hospital, in isolation no, not yet, I\'ll threaten him with hopital if he doesn\'t behave I\'ll cancel everything and I\'ll come back tonight to make sure he\'s not waking Don\'t cancel the trip to Taiwan, not yet Chester\'s back Point for Green Mandela, this is the delegation who...

All Blacks play England tomorrow then we\'ll know I see, you will make sure that my schedule is free for the entire match oh yes Dada This is good This is very good Why do not we do a little work while we\'re here? Just enjoy the rugby. so let me understand this the All Blacks are killing a team that trashed us last year Thanks for reminding me. we\'re gonna really have to tackle against the English are those the judicial appointments for the free states? they\'ll keep until after the match Here\'s the kick I am the president, you know And the conversion is good are you watching this guy? he\'s about your size how much you suppose he weighs? same as me Ya, but you\'re slow he looks or contact every time he gets the ball yup It\'s good for us I will break my arm, my leg, my neck, but I will not let that guy go Well said Well said ...when you pass it grab this Run! still think I\'m wasting my time with the rugby? he\'s in the clear and he will... tell the minister of sport I would like a full report on the All Blacks this rugby, it\'s still strictly political? oh yes, oh yes of course hello, hello Francois... don\'t lose them, I won\'t be able to get more thanks Francois Wait, there is a forth who\'s that for? the All Blacks beat lreland 43 to 19 I see they beat Wales 34 to 9 I see they beat Japan 145 to 17 It is a new international record they beat Scotland 48 to 13 in the quarter finals you saw the match with England yes not that close They seem unstoppable If the opposing team plays them face up, Lomo runs wild if they focus on Lomo, that leaves others free. And then there\'s Hacca a Maori war mask, yes, it is very powerful sources say half of the All Black matches are won before the start because of it How can we beat them? I have the coaches number, maybe you can call him and ask no no, I don\'t want to distract their focus, even for one minute But how can we win? Maybe we won\'t, they\'re favored 2 to 1 we\'ve already exceeded all expectations on and off the field It is not enough, not now. Not so close. This country is hungry for greatness. brought one of your Mom\'s protien shakes thinking about tomorrow? no tomorrow is taken care of one way or another I was thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell and come out ready to forgive the people who put you in Go home man, there\'s nothing more you can do today ever mentioned to you I hate the rugby? once or twice, yes I just want to get him through tomorrow safely, that\'s all we all do the tickets sold out long before the team became popular there\'s not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there and that\'s the reality now all it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement Or one fool who thinks god is speaking to him through the radio and it\'s happened before but not today Not on our watch, and not today We are on the spot on this historic day where even this early, crowd expectation is at fever pitch because there beloved green and gold has managed to defy all expectations but now they come up against a team unlike any they have faced before these All Blacks are possibly one of the greates international sides ever with a player as dominant as any this correspondant has ever seen final approach captain let it be noted that I\'m taking control of the aircraft duly noted I take full responsibility for what happens from now on Do you see that jet to the east? did they get clearance for this? not from us Where is he?
