['\n\n                        What was that? Just a child of the night, Jonathan. Come. sit here beside me on the veranda. It\'s chilly out here. Oh, no, it isn\'t. It\'s beautiful. I love the night so. I\'ve never seen you look so beautiful before, Nina. so pale. so... Luminescent. so... Yes? - Your lips are so red. - Are they? Would you like to kiss them? Why are you looking at me so strangely, Nina? Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has anyone ever told you... it was beautiful? - No. - Come. Lay your head on my breast. stop... you creature of the night! Who are you who interrupts my nightly feeding? I... am... Peter Vincent... vampire killer! Keep away! Keep away from me! And now your host... Peter Vincent. Fright Night! This is Peter Vincent... bringing you Fright Night Theatre. Charley! Peter Vincent\'s on. Forget Peter Vincent. But you love him. But I love you more. Tonight\'s journey into horror is Blood Castle. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. - Stop it. - I know it will. It is one of my favourites. And for a very good reason. I star in it. Fright Night! Charley, I said stop it! Jesus, Amy, give me a break! We\'ve been going together almost a year. All I ever hear is "Charley, stop it." I\'m sorry. Me too. I\'m just scared, that\'s all. Let\'s get into bed. You mean it? Charley... I\'m ready. Amy, you\'re not gonna believe this. There are two guys in the yard carrying a coffin. We have pledged ourselves to evil. Sure. And they\'re on the moors, right? - Amy, I\'m serious. - So am I. Do you want to make love or not? Amy, quick, come here. You gotta see this. Okay, maybe it wasn\'t a coffin... but I saw two guys carrying something into that house. I don\'t understand you. First you want to make love, and then you don\'t. What\'s wrong? Nothing, Mom. Come in here, you two. Are you kids having a lovers\' spat? No, Mom. Nothing like that. Well, there\'s nothing wrong with it. The divorce rate is 76% higher... among couples who don\'t argue before marriage. - We\'re in high school! - Never hurts to plan ahead. Amy, will you remind your mother we\'re playing poker at her house this weekend? Yes, Mrs Brewster. Good night, Charley. Yeah, good night. - Good night, Mrs Brewster. - Good night. Thanks for helping with Charley\'s homework. Anytime. See you tomorrow, Charley? Charley, that wasn\'t very nice, not walking Amy to the front door. There are people next door. I guess the new owner\'s moving in. - What new owner? - Didn\'t I tell you? Bob Hoskins said he finally got rid of the place. - Who\'d he sell it to? - Some fella who fixes up houses. Supposed to be very attractive. I just hope he knows what he\'s getting into with this house. It\'s gonna take a lot of work-- A man was found murdered tonight behind the railroad yards. Details are pending, awaiting notification of next of kin. Thank you, Mr Smith. Have a good weekend. That bastard! Why didn\'t he tell us he was gonna spring a pop quiz? That\'s the point to a pop quiz-- to surprise you. Thanks, teach. Hey, Amy. Did she finally find out what you\'re really like? Buzz off, Evil. Oh. Call me anything you want. You\'re the one failing trig, not me. Is this 99 Oak? No, that\'s next door. Thanks. - Hey, Mom? - Yeah. I\'m in here. Have you seen the new guy next door? No, but he\'s got a live-in carpenter. With my luck, he\'s probably gay. I don\'t think so. - Why? What do you know that I don\'t? - Oh, nothing. I gotta go study. Study? You? Hi. I\'m really sorry about the other night. It was my fault, not yours. It was? Look, Amy, I love you. I never wanna fight with you again. I\'m so glad we\'re getting this straightened out. - Police have reported a second murder. - I\'ve been miserable the past two days. The second victim, whose body was found this morning... was a known prostitute. Not talkin\' to you on the phone-- Charley, are you listening to me? The mutilated corpse was found under the North Creek bridge by the old mill. There are no leads-- - Know what I heard on the police band? - What? That wasn\'t the only murder. The second in two days. And get this-- both of \'em had their heads chopped off. Can you believe it? You\'re sick. You\'re so cool, Brewster! I can\'t stand it! Hey, kid! - What are you doing? - Nothin\'. Oh, yeah? Well, just make sure that it stays that way... kid. Mom, get up! I can\'t believe what\'s happening next door! - What? - He has fangs. The guy who bought the house has fangs. Fangs. That\'s lovely. I have to get up at 7:00 tomorrow. Fangs? Charley! You forgot something. This microwave never melts the marshmallows right. Drink that. I don\'t need hot cocoa. I didn\'t have a nightmare. They did kill a girl over there. - How late did you stay up studying? - Mom, I\'m not sick! The guy did have fangs. A bat did fly over my head and a second later he stepped out of the shadows. Don\'t you see what that means? Wait, let me guess. What? He\'s a vampire! A what? A vampire! Haven\'t you listened to anything I\'ve said? Charley, is this some sort of a trick.. to get me back? Forget it. I\'m going to the police. You can\'t tell the police that. They\'ll lock you up. All right, I won\'t tell them he\'s a vampire. But I sure am gonna tell them about the two women. You\'re sure about this now? - Yes? - Mr Dandrige? No, I\'m his roommate, Billy Cole. Lieutenant Lennox, Homicide. Do you mind if we come in? No, not at all. Come on in. This is quite a place you have here. - Yeah. We\'re restoring it. - Where is Mr Dandrige? He\'s away on business. - Can I help you? - There was a murder last night. Your neighbour Charley thinks he saw the victim in this house. That\'s impossible. I was here with Jerry last night. - There was nobody else here. - That\'s a lie. I saw him carry her body out in a plastic bag. What do you say to that? Kid\'s crazy. I took some bags out, but they were full of trash. Amy? Here, let me show you. Look, the bag I saw had a body in it, not trash. You actually see the body, Charley? - Well, no, but-- - Okay. Let me take you out back I\'ll show you the bags I put in the garbage. - Okay, let\'s see them. - I can prove he\'s lying! Let\'s look in the basement instead. What\'s down there, Charley? Yes, Charley. What\'s down there? Obviously the boy\'s made a mistake, Officer. A coffin! That\'s what\'s down there. I saw them carry it in. What? Jerry Dandrige is in it, sleeping the sleep of the undead. What are you talking about? - He\'s a vampire. - Uh-oh! I saw him last night. He had fangs, and he bit her on the neck For heaven\'s sake! - Come on. - What? Wait! We can\'t just leave like this! I got a coffin for you! I don\'t care what you say! Lieutenant, please listen to me! Look, I\'m telling you, Jerry Dandrige is a vampire. Sure, and I\'m Dirty Harry. Listen. If I ever catch your ass at the station again, I\'m throwing it in jail forever! Lieutenant, just listen to me for a second! I know it\'s crazy! I know that, but-- Look, Lieutenant-- Oh, my God. Evil! And to what do I owe this dubious pleasure? The vampire knows I know about him. Or at least he will when he wakes up tonight. What are you talking about? A vampire is living next door to me... and he\'s gonna kill me if I don\'t protect myself. - What? - I haven\'t got time to explain. Just tell me what to do to protect myself. Very funny, Brewster. Evil, please! I\'m not kidding! - Tell me what to do! - Don\'t call me Evil any more! Why should I help you anyway? Look, I\'ve got eight bucks. Help me and it\'s yours. Far be it from me to turn down a fool\'s money. Where and when do you expect the vampire to attack? In my bedroom, tonight. Start with this. But you must have total faith in it for it to work Then get some garlic. Links of the stuff you can wear around your neck and hang from your window. If he comes for you, that\'ll be the way. Then-- Oh, of course! There\'s holy water! But you gotta get a priest to say a blessing over it first. - That\'s it? - I\'m afraid so. But your best protection right now, Charles... is that a vampire cannot enter your house... without being invited by the rightful owner first. - Are you sure? - Positive. Thank you. Thank you. Charley, could you come here, please? There\'s someone I\'d like you to meet. Yeah, Mom. Charley, this is our next-door neighbour... Jerry Dandrige. Hello, Charley. Charley, don\'t be rude. Shake hands. - What\'s he doing here? - I invited him for a drink You what? I invited him over. Why? What\'s the matter, Charley? Afraid I\'d never come over without being invited first? You\'re quite right. Of course, now that I\'ve been made welcome... I\'ll probably drop by quite a bit. In fact, anytime I feel like it. With your mother\'s kind permission, of course. Oh, Jerry, anytime. It\'s nice that someone interesting has finally moved into the neighbourhood. Charley, are you all right? Yeah, Mom, I\'m fine. I just gotta get back to my trig. Nice to meet you. See you. Soon. We wouldn\'t want towake your mother, would we? Then I\'d have to kill her too. Right? Do you realize how much trouble you\'ve caused me? Spying on me. Almost disturbing my sleep this afternoon. Telling policemen about me! You deserve to die, boy. Of course, I could give you something I don\'t have. A choice. Forget about me, Charley. Forget about me, and I\'ll forget about you. What do you say, Charley? Fool. Charley! Charley, can you hear me? Charley, is that you? My door is stuck - What is going on? - Nothing. I just had a nightmare. I had one last night. It was awful. I was at this white sale and suddenly realized I was stark naked. - Now what is it? - Nothing. Just raccoons in the garbage again. - Go back to sleep. - But what about your nightmare? - Do you want a Valium? - I\'m fine now. - Honest. - I do need my sleep. I start the night shift tomorrow. - It\'s so bad for my complexion. - Good night, Mom. I know you\'re there, Charley. I can see you. What\'s the matter, Charley? scared? You started this, Charley, and I\'m gonna finish it. I just destroyed your car, Charley. But that\'s nothing compared to what I\'m gonna do to you... tomorrow night. Once again, your host... Peter Vincent. Good evening, horror fans. Did you know there are a lot of people... who do not believe in vampires? But I do... because I know they exist. I have fought them in all their guises-- man, wolves, bats-- and I have always won! That is why they call me... the great vampire killer. Now... watch me do it. Go, Peter. Go. Mr Vincent, could I talk to you for a minute? Please, Mr Vincent. It\'s very, very important. - What do you want me to sign? - Pardon me? You do want my autograph, don\'t you? No, sir, I was curious about what you said last night on TV... about believing in vampires. What about it? Were you serious? Oh, absolutely. Unfortunately, none of your generation seems to be. What do you mean? I have just been fired because nobody wants to see vampire killers any more... or vampires either. Apparently all they want are demented madmen... running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins. Excuse me. I believe in vampires. That\'s nice. If only there had been more of you, perhaps my ratings would\'ve been higher. In fact, I have one living next door to me. Would you help me kill him? Pardon me? You know that murder a few days ago? Yes. The guy who lives next door to me did it, and he\'s a vampire. If this is your idea of a joke, I am not amused. Mr Vincent, I am not joking. I am deadly serious. Well, if you would excuse me-- But, Mr Vincent, you have to believe me. I\'m telling the truth. You just said you believed in vampires. I lied. Now, if you will leave me alone-- You have to listen to me! The vampire tried to kill me last night... and trashed my car when he didn\'t succeed. He\'s gonna be back tonight. If I don\'t get help, he\'s gonna kill me. Mr Vincent! Just listen to me for a second. No! Wait! Please, Mr Vincent! Wait! - What are you doing here? - What about you? You just dumped him. - It\'s none of your business. - So you do like him. Anybody home? Wow. What\'s all this for? Self-defence. Not that I think I\'ll need it. He\'ll be dead before nightfall. - Who will be? - Dandrige. I\'m waiting for the guy he lives with to leave, then I\'m gonna find his coffin... and pound this through his heart. That\'s murder, Charley. You can\'t murder a vampire, Amy. They\'re dead. Remember? Listen. I just taped this. Amy. What are we gonna do? This is just like Fright Night. Now for the news. Another young woman\'s body was discovered this morning... in back of the sheridan Mall-- I don\'t have any choice. Somebody has to stop him. It\'s gonna be dangerous going into that house all alone. You\'ll need all the help you can get. Somebody like Peter Vincent, for instance? I tried him already. Well, let us try again before you do anything. There\'s not enough time, Amy. Well, what happens if you go into that house alone... and he gets you? Who\'s gonna stop him then? Yeah. Then he\'ll be able to suck his way through the entire town. Not that it would be much of a loss. Charley, it\'s gonna be dark soon. You don\'t want to go into that house then, do you? No, you\'re right there. - All right, try him again. - Great. You promise you\'re not gonna do anything till you hear from us? Okay. Come on. You don\'t believe me, do you? I love you, Charley. Hey, Amy, come on! Yes? Mr. Vincent, could we talk to you for a moment? I\'m afraid now is not the best time. Please. It\'s very important. Well, if you would just... wait there for one moment-- Come in! What can I do for you? An autograph, perhaps? Perhaps an interview for your school newspaper? I\'m afraid this is much more important. Really? What could be more important than my autograph? Saving a boy\'s life. Oh. Yes. I can see where that could be more important. Perhaps you would care to explain. Remember a fruitcake kid named Charley Brewster? He said he saw you. The one who believes a vampire lives next to him. Oh, yes. You know, he is insane. Oh, my dear... I do hope he\'s not a friend of yours. Yeah, she\'s got the hots for the creep. Amy! We need your help to stop him. He really believes his next-door neighbour is a vampire... and he\'s planning to kill him. With a stake through the heart. Are you two serious? Oh, my dear. Your friend needs a psychiatrist, not a vampire killer. - Please, Mr Vincent. - I\'m afraid not. You see, Hollywood beckons. I have just been offered a starring role in a major film. I have even had to quit Fright Night. - I\'ll give you money. - How much? I have a $500 savings bond. I\'ll take it. Now, how are we going to cure your little friend... of this delusion? I got it all figured out. We all go next door to the neighbour... and you perform some kind of vampire test on him... to pronounce him human. You know. Like in Orgy of the Damned? Where you looked in the mirror... the guy didn\'t have a reflection, so then you knew he was a vampire. Oh, yes. That was one of my favourite roles. Do you know... I still... have the prop. It\'s for you. Yes, this is Jerry Dandrige. I see. Well, yes, of course. I\'m always willing to help young people... but I\'m afraid that crosses are out of the question. You see, I\'ve been reborn recently. He\'s a reborn Christian. He thinks crosses would be sacrilegious. - Ask him how he feels about holy water. - How about holy water? No. Won\'t do either. Tell him it\'s ordinary tap water. All he has to do is sip it. Oh, yes. Yes. Okay. That sounds fine. But don\'t bring him over until 6:00 tomorrow. I\'ll be out until then. Seems we don\'t have to go out tonight after all. His friends are bringing him over tomorrow night... to prove to him that I\'m not... a vampire. It\'s 6:10. He said he was gonna be here at 6:00. He said he\'d be here. He\'ll be here. Here he comes! Thank you. Charley Brewster, I presume. Peter Vincent, vampire killer. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this. Good evening. Now, down to business. Where is the lair of the suspected creature of the night? There. Oh, yes. I see what you mean. There is a distinct possibility. Now, shall we go? Wait. Where\'s your stakes and hammers? I left them in my bag. You\'re not going in there without them. But I have to prove that he is a vampire before I kill him, Charley. Look, I know he\'s a vampire! I am the one who has to know, Charley. How are you gonna do that? This is holy water. If a drop touches him, he will blister. I have asked him to drink it... while we all watch. He readily agreed. But if I\'m right and you prove he is a vampire... he\'ll kill us all. No, he won\'t, Charley. After all, I am here to protect you, and I am Peter Vincent! I know, Mr Vincent, but-- Hey! Peter Vincent. Billy Cole. This is a pleasure. Won\'t you all come in? And Charley. Hey, Jer! They\'re here. Perhaps he didn\'t hear you. He heard me, all right. Mr Vincent. I\'ve seen all your films... and I\'ve found them... very amusing. Oh. Thank you. And who are these two... attractive young people? Ed Thompson. Amy Peterson. Charmed. Isn\'t that what vampires are supposed to do, Charley? - Please. - That\'s some vampire, Brewster. God, he\'s neat. Please excuse the mess. I haven\'t finished unpacking. Where do you keep your coffin? Or do you have more than one? Charley! It\'s all right, Mr Vincent. I\'m quite used to it by now. As you may or may not know, Charley even brought the police over a few days ago. Charley, you didn\'t! Damn right I did. Only they didn\'t believe me any more than any of you. But you\'ll believe me soon. Give him the holy water. Charley, there\'s no reason to be rude about this. It\'s perfectly all right, Mr Vincent. Where is it? And are you sure that this is holy water? Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless it all at St Mary\'s myself. Get ready to run. I\'ll protect you. Bottoms up. There. Satisfied? Totally. Well, now, Charley, you saw that. Are you convinced now that Mr Dandrige is not a vampire? It can\'t be. But, Charley, you saw it. You know as well as I do that no vampire can drink blessed water. Then it wasn\'t blessed. Arey ou calling me a liar, young man? If he\'s not a vampire... have him touch this. You\'ve made a fool of yourself once. There\'s no reason to compound the error. You\'ve already caused your friends quite enough pain. You wouldn\'t want to cause them any more, would you? No, of course not. Then you\'re finally convinced I\'m not a vampire either? Right? Yes. Well, I\'m glad that\'s settled. I can\'t tell you how much I appreciate this, Mr Vincent. -You\'ve been a great help. - Glad to be of service. It was very nice meeting both of you. Feel free to drop by anytime. You\'ll always be welcome. I\'d like that, Mr Dandrige. Please call me Jerry. Let\'s get out of here. That goes for you too, Ed. I expect we have a lot of the same interests--horror movies, the occult. Something wrong, Mr Vincent? I just felt a little-- It was just my clumsiness. Are you sure? I\'m positive. We have been taking up much too much of your time. Thank you so much. Come along now, everybody. Thank you. Bye-bye. - What\'s wrong with you? - Nothing. - Then why are you shaking? - I\'m not shaking. You saw something that convinced you he was a vampire, didn\'t you? - Of course not! - Please, Mr Vincent. You have to tell me. All right! He didn\'t cast a reflection in my mirror. - Satisfied now? - You have to call the police! Shit! Where are you goin\', pencil dick? - Home! - No way. We walk Amy home first. Looks just like her, doesn\'t she? One good thing-- they\'ll never believe him now. No? - Let\'s cut through here. - No way! We want people and lights. The more, the better. Listen, Brewster, vampires don\'t exist. Haven\'t you figured that out yet? What if you\'re wrong, Evil? What if Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it? Would you walk down that alley then? Oh, fuck you, Brewster. Evil, just stick with us, all right? Forget it! You may be chicken shit, but I\'m not. - What\'ll we do? - Let him go. No vampire\'s gonna want him anyway. Probably give him blood poisoning. Jesus! I warned him! He got me, Charley! He bit me! You know what you\'re gonna have to do now, don\'t you? Kill me. Kill me, Charley... before I turn into a vampire... and give you a hickey! You asshole! You really believed me, you poor dope! You\'ll get yours someday. Oh, yeah ? When? When I\'m bit by a vampire? There are no such things as vampires, fruitcake! Charley, Amy, is that you? It\'s not working. I\'m not scared. Hello, Edward. You don\'t have to be afraid of me. I know what it\'s like being different. Only they won\'t pick on you any more... or beat you up. I\'ll see to that. All you have to do is take my hand. Here, Edward. Take my hand. What was that? Just Evil messing around again. Cut it out, Evil! It\'s not funny! Amy, what if Evil was really in trouble? You\'re not gonna let him sucker you in again, are you? Don\'t tell me this is a power outage. Well, what else would it be? Hey! You can\'t come in here! - Who are you calling? - The police. Who is it? Me. Evil Ed. - What do you want? - There\'s a vampire out here. Let me in. What are we going to do? What are you gonna do? Not me! I used to admire you. You know that? But, of course... that was before... I found out what a fake you were! Peter Vincent... the great vampire killer! What have you done to me? Back! The master will kill you for this. But not fast. Slowly. Oh, so slowly. Back I say back! He doesn\'t believe me! I\'m scared, Charley. I\'m really scared. I am not going to let him get you, Amy. I promise. You got Peter Vincent\'s number? He doesn\'t care about us! I paid him to be there today. It doesn\'t matter, Amy. We don\'t have any choice. Now give me his number. Look, you\'ve gotta help us. Dandrige has me and Amy trapped in this club downtown. No, Charley. I\'m sorry. I just can\'t do that. You\'ve gotta come. You\'re the only one who knows what\'s going on. Let her go. Filthy son of a bitch! Shouldn\'t lose your temper, Charley. It isn\'t polite. You can\'t kill me here. I don\'t wanna kill you, Charley. I want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house-- just the two of you. That is, ifyou everwant to see Amy again. - Let her go! - I got him. - She\'s mine. - You want chicken, go someplace else. - Out of my way. - Move me. Leon! - Peter, open the door! - Who is it? It\'s me. Charley Brewster. Let me in. - Are you one of them? - What are you talking about? Here. Grab this. Come on. We don\'t have very much time. Dandrige chased me and Amy all over town. He trapped us in a nightclub. - What are you doing? - I\'m leaving. - You can\'t! - just watch me. But Dandrige has Amy! He\'s gonna kill her unless we come to his house. Oh, my God. The police. I\'ll call the police. No, Peter. No! They won\'t believe you. I\'ve tried. Peter, it\'s just us. We\'re gonna have to save Amy. I can\'t. I... was paid to be there today. I know. And you still want me to help you? Yes! You\'re Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer! That is a character in a movie! That isn\'t even my real name. I\'m terrified. I\'m sorry, Charley, but I am. I can\'t do it alone, Peter. If you don\'t help, Amy is gonna die. Me too, probably. Please, Peter. I\'m sorry, Charley. She\'s someone I knew a long time ago. Where am I? Where\'s Charley? Where? Peter Vincent. Ready to do battle with the undead. This is serious. I am serious. Here. Hold this. Go on. Let\'s see. Flashlight, stakes, hammer. Ah, yes. Cross. What about Billy Cole? How are you gonna stop him? I\'m going to use this. It is from Orgy of the Damned. What if he\'s not human? Bullets aren\'t gonna stop him then. He walks around in the daylight, now, doesn\'t he? - Hmm? - Yeah. Well, then. He is human. Come on. You don\'t have to do this. - I want to thank you-- - Not now. What\'s wrong? Nothing. Nothing at all. Are you crazy? Not the front door. Let\'s go around the back and sneak in. Too late. I am Peter Vincent... the great vampire killer. This way. Did you hear something? No. Let\'s come back at dawn. You see, he\'ll be asleep then. We\'ll have a better chance of getting Amy. And Amy will be dead by then too. Now come on. Welcome to Fright Night. For real. Where\'s Amy? Up here. All you have to do is get by me. Back, spawn of Satan! Oh, really? You have to have faith... for this to work on me... Mr Vincent. Stop! Back We\'re gonna make it. Mrs Brewster! Operator, get me the-- Thank God. The phone wires have been cut. I know. I did it! Where is Charley\'s mother? Well, apparently she\'s working nights. But she left a note. His dinner\'s in the oven! You wanted her. There she is. Here. You\'re gonna need it. Just before dawn. What have you done to her? I\'m gonna have to break the door down. You make as much noise as you can. Help! Let me out! Please! Open the door! Help! Somebody! I think she just opened her eyes. All right. Grab her. Let\'s get out of here. We can\'t. Look Oh, my God. Something wrong? Yes. We have a visitor. Is it too late to save her? No. Not if we kill Dandrige before dawn. Are you sure? So far, everything has been like it was in movies. Now we just have to keep hoping. Let\'s go. Well, what do we have here? Vampire killers? Stop or I\'ll shoot. I mean it. Don\'t force me to shoot. Stop! We have him. Do you? What did he mean by that? Nothing. He was just bluffing. She\'s worse! Come on. We\'re running out of time. Amy. Awake. I command you... to awake! Show me how much you love me, Amy. Kill them... both! He\'s on the roof. I\'m going up there. He\'s not up here. Look out! He\'s going downstairs. So. Stay back Back You have to have faith for that to work.. Mr Vincent! Remember? You\'re out of time, Mr Dandrige. Look over your shoulder. Back! - Are you all right? - Yeah. Quick he\'s in the basement. Quick his coffin has got to be down here somewhere. What was that? You keep searching. I\'ll check it out. Amy? It\'s me. I know. I found it. Don\'t be frightened, Charley. Hurry. Get it open! He\'s locked it from the inside. What\'s wrong? Don\'t you want me any more? It\'s not my fault, Charley. You promised you wouldn\'t let him get me! You promised! Charley, watch out! Amy! Look! We\'ve been going in a circle. We\'re right back where we started from. Ladies and gentlemen, Fright Night Theatre. This is Peter Vincent... back once more with you... as host of Fright Night. I thought I\'d let the vampires rest for a little while. Right, Charley? Tonight, the threat comes not from beyond the grave... but from beyond the stars... as alien beings stalk an unwary summer camp... in Mars Wants Flesh. I do not star in it. Is something wrong? Nothing. Oh, you\'re so cool, Brewster!', '\n                    ']
