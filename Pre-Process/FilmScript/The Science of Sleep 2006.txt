['\n\n                        Stargate SG-1: True Science', ' Welcome to Stargate Command.', " I'm Amanda Tapping and", ' I play Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.', ' Samantha is chief scientist', ' and leader of an elite team called SG-1.', " SG-1's mission is to travel through", ' an amazing device called a Stargate', ' to planets on the far reaches of the galaxy.', ' There they fight unspeakably evil aliens,', ' commune with higher beings,', ' and use fantastic technology.', ' Oh... and of course they often save humanity', ' and the galaxy from complete annihilation.', ' On the show "Stargate SG-1", we take pride in pushing', ' science fiction to the limits of human imagination.', ' alien parasites,', ' parallel universes,', ' time travel,', ' wormholes through space and time.', " Some might say it's just fantasy,", ' but amazingly,', " it doesn't mean it's not true.", ' In the next hour,', " we're going on a different journey", ' not just through the set of Stargate', ' but also into the world of real science', ' to see that what seems like crazy sci-fi fantasies', ' might actually be true.', ' Callie Sullivan', ' Science fiction and science seem to be', ' getting closer and closer all the time,', " and I think there's a good reason for that.", " They're both about the human imagination;", ' they\'re both about asking "What if?" questions;', " they're both about trying to understand", ' our place in a very complex universe.', ' We read the newspaper and current science magazines,', ' watch the news,', ' look for things that are sort of interesting,', ' hot button issues', ' that often come up and will inspire us.', ' We read up on black holes, we read', ' Stephen Hawking and most of it goes over my head but', ' the fun part of what

the same kind of problems that the scientists do,', ' and in many cases I think the science fiction writers', ' are coming closer to the truth than the scientists.', " It's so grounded in true scientific terminology and", ' things that can actually happen in the universe', ' that, for the people that are more knowledgeable and', " don't just watch it for the fantasy and escapism,", ' can find their hook into it', ' in the actual science of it.', ' Science is great, but in fiction you still need', ' a battle between good and evil.', ' From the very beginning of the series,', " SG-1 have had to face humanity's nemesis,", " a race of aliens so evil, they won't rest", " 'til they've enslaved the entire galaxy.", ' They have filled our nightmares,', ' they have made us take terrible risks.', ' At times we thought we had lost the battle.', ' They are...', " the Goa'uld.", ' Now the idea of this creature burrowing', ' inside your body, taking over your brain', ' and dominating your behaviour', ' is one of the scariest things', ' that occurred in "Stargate".', ' It happened to my character Samantha early on', ' in the show, and let me tell you, she hated it.', ' Sci-fi writers have come up with', ' some pretty evil aliens over the years,', " but the Goa'uld must certainly rank", ' as one of the nastiest.', ' In true sci-fi style, the snake-like', " parasites, the Goa'uld,", ' took over the minds of their army', ' of warrior slaves, the Jaffa,', ' and then set about trying to rule the galaxy.', " But one brave Jaffa slave, Teal'c, saw the truth", " and broke free from the parasites' control.", ' He joined up with us, the team from Stargate,', ' and the battle for the universe began.', ' Exciting stuff, eh?', ' This parasitical race of beings', ' could only survive in a host body,', ' so they actually went to ancient Egypt', ' and acquired a bunch of human hosts,', ' inhabited their bodies and controlled them', ' until they were mature enough', ' to take on a permanent host, so basically a Jaffa is', " an incubator for the larval form of the Goa'uld.", " It's not something you can shoot or run away from,", " it's inside you and it's controlling you,", " and there's this icky factor to it, you know,", " it's gross and they're pretty disgusting,", ' these snaky things that sort of burrow', ' their way into the back of your head.', ' As an intelligent and totally evil parasite,', " the Goa'uld are terrifying adversaries,", " but we don't have to look far on our own planet", ' to find creatures equally as horrifying.', ' If you were a visitor from outer space', ' and came to Earth', ' and really studied its living organisms objectively,', ' and then went back home,', ' what would you say to the folks back home?', ' "Most of what\'s living down there is a parasite."', " Professor Janovy is the world's leading expert", ' on a very creepy kind of creature.', ' This is Monesia expansa, a tapeworm from sheep.', ' At the University of Nebraska, he runs one', " of the world's most unusual museums,", ' with over one hundred and fifty', ' thousand stomach-churning exhibits.', ' These are Fasciloides magna which came out of', ' the liver of a white-tailed deer.', ' Each of the creatures in his museum succeeds by', ' sucking the very life force from another living creature.', ' This is Ascaris lumbercoides, or roundworms.', ' These worms infect about one ou', ' of every four people on Earth.', " That's the one schoolkids get, remember?", ' You see, we humans are', ' a perfect snug and warm place', ' for parasites.', ' This is Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm,', ' that human beings get from eating uncooked beef.', ' I think if we laid that out on a table and measured it,', ' it would probably be fifteen or twenty feet long, easily,', ' and humans can have any number of these things.', " Disgusting parasites like this are nature's vampires.", ' They take advantage of other creatures', ' using their body as a free lunch.', ' They are ruthless, taking what they need,', ' reproducing, and then moving on.', ' And revoltingly, we humans are', ' the perfect place for them to live.', ' Yuck!', ' There are a big variety of parasites', ' that infect human beings:', ' lice, ticks, flukes that live in the bloodstream.', ' There are large nemetodes that live in your intestines,', ' there are parasites that live in your mouth.', ' Some of them cause very', ' destructive erosion of the skin,', ' others are very damaging', ' to the spleen and to the liver.', ' There are at least two hundred species that some of us,', ' at least, have been infected with over the years.', " What makes the Goa'uld so particularly scary", ' is that they totally take over their human host.', ' But, you guessed it, it turns out this crazy science', ' fiction fantasy is actually based on real science.', ' There are many reported cases in nature of parasites', ' being able to change the behaviour of their hosts.', ' These are pictures of Dicrocoelium dendriticum.', ' They live part of their life cycle', " within an ant's body and brain.", " It's a parasite, just like", " the Goa'uld, only a bit smaller.", " Its larva digs its way to the ant's brain", " where it perverts the ant's natural instincts,", ' so instead of the ant cowering safely', ' in the undergrowth like any good ant would,', ' it suddenly becomes compelled to self-destruct', ' by climbing to the top of a blade of grass', ' where passing sheep will eat it.', ' Once in the sheep, the parasit', ' can continue its revolting life cycle.', " Oh, but it doesn't just happen in ants, oh no!", ' Hold onto your stomachs,', ' because scientists suggest', ' that some parasites can actually', " make us humans do stuff we can't control.", ' For example, the pig tapeworm that human', ' beings get from eating uncooked pork,', ' those worms form cysts in various parts', ' of the body, including the brain,', ' and as a result', ' we have all kinds', ' of behavioural changes, dizziness, lethargy,', ' sometimes a loss of vision,', ' so this is another case in which', ' our behaviour is altered by a parasite.', ' So if tapeworms can change our behaviour', ' and make us dizzy and tired,', ' is it possible that an alien parasite like', " the Goa'uld could control our minds completely?", ' The evolutionary rules say that', ' there has to be a reason for it,', ' so maybe infection with a certain kind of', ' tapeworm might make us become evil or criminal.', " If there's a reason that has to do with...", ' reproductive success, then sure, why not?', ' Scared yet?', ' You should be,', ' because as it turns out, Professor Janovy believes', ' we might not be the dominant creatures on Earth.', " It's the parasites.", ' They infect everything, they are more diverse,', ' they are successful in occupying environments', ' that we would consider not necessarily places to live.', ' In some cases they control populations.', " It's the most successful way of life on Earth.", ' Does she please you my love?', ' This Stargate forms the battleground', ' in our struggle between the powers of good', ' and the powers of evil.', ' On our side at Stargate Command,', ' helping us are various aliens like the Asgard,', " the Tok'Ra, and humans all around the galaxy.", " Against us are the terrifying parasites the Goa'uld,", ' and the unstoppable and insatiable Replicators.', ' At first, we at the SGC fought', ' them with our low-tech Earth guns,', ' but pretty soon, we discovered these.', ' This is a staff weapon,', ' and this is a zat gun.', ' One blast and your enemy is stunned,', ' two and they die.', ' Now you may think this is pure science fiction,', ' but it turns out that the truth is much more strange.', " What you're seeing here is the taser.", " It's a hand-held gun that brings criminals", ' to their knees by blasting them with a fierce', ' jolt of fifty thousand volts of electricity.', ' The amazing thing is that the taser can knock down', ' a suspect without killing or even harming them.', ' But the US government are secretly', ' developing something far more powerful.', " It's called the Active Denial System.", ' This classified new weapon works', ' by emitting a beam of microwaves,', ' like the ones you get in your microwave oven', ' but much more concentrated.', ' It is, so the experts say, a perfect ray gun.', ' So with ray gun weapons', ' that stun already in development,', ' are guns that can actually disintegrate', ' a person too far-fetched?', " In order to vaporise you, I'd have to heat", ' you up to about a hundred million degrees,', ' and the energy required to do that is immense,', ' just literally immense,', " so it's hard to imagine in a hand-held device", " that you'd be able to do those sorts of things.", ' Directed energy weapons can be useful', ' in certain contexts, they can burn things,', ' they can destroy electronics,', ' they can blind people, that sort of thing.', ' After the break,', " I'll be showing you more of the Stargate set,", " and we'll come face to face with one of the most fierce", " and terrifying of all of mankind's adversaries,", ' and finding out whether their', ' Earth-based relatives should be loved,', ' or feared.', ' The time has come to meet the Replicators.', ' Not that I wanna show off or anything,', ' but "Stargate" is currently one of the', ' longest-running science fiction series in the world,', ' watched by nearly twenty million', ' people in over eighty countries.', ' Not bad, eh?', " It's amazing that people enjoy the show,", ' because really the heroes of the show ar', ' a bunch of screw-ups who are always causing,', ' you know,', ' horrible problems for themselves and everyone else.', " I guess it's the fact that they occasionally", ' make up for it or get out of those problems', ' that keep people coming back.', ' The series is shot in over nine', ' sound stages in Vancouver, Canada.', ' The show employs a crew and cast', ' numbering more than five hundred,', ' and its punishing schedule turns out', ' one episode every seven days.', " That's pretty fast, but you wouldn't", ' know it by the atmosphere here on set.', " As you see, we don't take ourselves very seriously and", " there's none of that... you know,", ' TV star attitude.', " It won't be tolerated at all.", " If you've got a joke, action has to wait,", ' you know,', " and so it's always about laughter first.", ' At the heart of all the adventures', ' Samantha Carter and SG-1 get involved in,', ' and what makes this show particularly unique', ' is this,', ' the Stargate itself.', " It's an amazing device inscribed with unusual symbols.", ' It looks beautiful, but what makes it truly amazing', " is that it's a gateway through time and space.", ' "Stargate" imagines that there', ' are thousands, if not more, devices,', ' ring-shaped devices not unlike', ' the one behind me all over the galaxy', ' by which you can travel from planet', ' to planet simply by stepping through it', ' and it takes you instantaneously', ' from one planet to another.', ' In fact,', ' I think the Stargate is one of the reasons', " the show's been running for so long,", " it's because the Stargate itself is", ' a terrific device for storytelling.', ' And the fact of the matter is,', " this is a, you know, it's a great prop.", " I mean, it's a doorway, because essentially it's,", ' every week, it\'s "Where are we gonna go?"', " You know, it's like getting into", ' a rollercoaster with your best friends,', ' and you wanna take that ride this week.', ' In the series, this Stargate is one', ' of thousands throughout the galaxy', ' created by a mysterious', ' and powerful ancient civilisation.', ' You can cross limitless space in the blink o an eye', ' just by going through one Gate and out of another.', ' It really is instant interplanetary travel.', ' So how does it work?', ' As Samantha Carter is always trying', " to explain to the usually clueless Jack O'Neill,", ' a Stargate works by creating an artificial', ' wormhole through the space time continuum.', " That's a tunnel in time and space through which we can", ' travel, covering huge distances in just a short moment.', ' So is this a flight of fantasy,', ' or a genuine piece of contemporary science?', ' Well, the truth may shock you.', ' Lawrence Krauss is a professor of physics and astronomy', " and leading expert on Einstein's theory of relativity.", " Some of the implications of Einstein's", ' famous theory are truly mind-blowing.', ' One of them is that empty space can bend.', " Now, I know that's a really hard idea", " to get your head around, but it's true.", ' Emptiness can be made to curve.', ' You see, Einstein told us', ' that mass or energy curve space.', ' And if I take this bowling ball here,', ' in this two-dimensional universe', ' you can see that when I put it down,', ' it literally curves the space around us,', ' and that allows all sorts', ' of interesting things to happen.', " So let's get this straight:", " Einstein's theory says that something really big,", ' something with a lot of gravity', ' like a star or a giant planet,', ' can literally bend space,', " and if it's big enough,", ' it can really bend it,', ' a lot.', ' Now, take this pole here,', " and say this is your universe and you're an ant living", " at this end. Well, it's a long way from here to there", ' that is, unless the space in which you live is curved.', " Well, you might think you're very close now,", ' you could just sort of jump across,', " but you can't, because there's no space there.", ' This is your space and', ' you still have to walk all the way around', ' unless you bring them closer together', ' and they actually touch.', ' That changes the topology of space.', " That's your shortcut.", " That's a wormhole.", ' So if we were smart,', ' we could theoretically bend space so much,', ' it actually comes right back on itself.', " You think that's crazy", ' watch this!', ' So here we are, Amanda,', " magically transported. There's space all", ' around us, with Stargate Command here,', ' and the moon way over there, two hundred and', ' fifty thousand miles away, pretty far.', ' But if we curve space around Stargate Command,', ' and round the moon,', ' and eventually', ' create a tunnel that touches,', ' create a little hole, then we have a tunnel,', ' a wormhole,', ' and the distance between', ' Stargate Command and the moon', ' is very small through the tunnel. In fact, if you look', " through the tunnel there, there's the moon", ' just on the other side.', ' See it? Pretty sexy...?', ' Mathematically they exist,', " they're consistent with the laws of physics,", " but you've still got to make them happen", " and we don't have very good", ' technology for dealing with wormholes.', ' Another problem with wormholes is,', ' they tend to be unstable,', ' they collapse. If you just build them and', ' leave them, they fall apart again.', ' The gravitational fields would be so strong', ' at either end of the wormhole', ' that each end will collapse into a black hole', ' out of which nothing could escape.', ' But even if scientists could succeed', ' in holding a black hole open,', ' passing through it would definitely', ' not be for the squeamish.', ' It could actually be really stressful going through', ' because space and time would be very very', ' heavily curved, enormous gravitational fields.', " Unless you're careful, you could be shredded.", ' Scientists have imagined that a wormhole would', ' probably look something like a floating crystal ball.', ' If you could see into it at all,', " you might see an inkling of what's on the other side,", ' and this is roughly speaking what the producers', ' of Stargate have made their Gate look like.', " It'd be a bit like a mirror.", ' When you look in the mirror,', ' you see another world.', ' When you walk round the back of the mirror,', " the other world isn't there,", ' but if you walked through the mirror like Alice,', " you're suddenly in the other world.", ' You can actually see', ' the fluctuations in the event horizon.', ' We have all sorts of reasons to believe', ' that making one would be very difficult,', ' but their existence is consistent', ' with the known laws of physics.', ' The Stargate has opened up a whole new world of', ' "save the universe" style adventures for us at SG-1,', ' and I have to say,', " we've met some terrifying and weird enemies.", ' This is my lab.', " It's here that I first realised that", ' these small pieces of alien technology', " formed Earth's most serious threat.", " Although humanity's fiercest and most", " memorable adversary are the parasitic Goa'uld,", " early on in SG-1's adventures we found ourselves", ' up against what seemed like an unstoppable enemy.', ' We thought we beat them once,', ' but soon they were back', ' bigger, better and bent', ' on universal domination.', ' They are...', ' the Replicators.', ' The Replicators are virtually unstoppable.', ' They devour anything they come across', ' and use that material to replicate themselves,', ' making themselves stronger', ' and more powerful as they go.', ' They can also assume different shapes, from', ' spider-like creatures right', ' through to spaceships and even humans.', ' In Series 8,', ' they even made a Replicator version of me.', ' And terrifyingly, the Replicators communicate', ' with each other through a common consciousness.', ' They have this greater capability because', ' they were all able to communicate with each other,', ' and they looked cool and they were scary and', ' we could shoot them and not feel guilty', ' about it because they were just machines.', ' It was born out of a desire to create', " another villain other than the Goa'uld", ' but that were shark-like in their killing potential.', " They couldn't really be reasoned with,", ' and so were deadly from that perspective.', ' Of course, here on Earth, scientists', ' are also working on our own Replicator-like robots.', ' These ones at the University of South Florida', ' can talk to each other and think together.', " But thankfully, they're designed to help us,", ' not kill us.', ' In fact, scientists have designed robots', ' that can help in the dangerous business of looking', ' for survivors in the aftermath of a disaster.', ' They are continually in use by the emergency services,', ' and even saw action following 9/11.', ' And a bit like the Replicators, they are highly mobile', ' and have a sophisticated communication network', ' perfect for search and rescue.', ' For search and rescue, there are really three types', ' of robots that you would be using.', " You've got ground robots which can go into the interior", " of the rubble and places that people and dogs can't go.", ' You also have aerial vehicles', ' which can be incredibly useful,', " particularly if you've got a hurricane or", " earthquake, where you've got", ' a large geographically distributed disaster.', " And then don't forget about water.", ' A lot of our cities are based around water and', " you wanna see if there's any leaks or cracks or", " if something's fixing to break", ' and cause a collapse of a bridge.', ' A lot of times right now, with the state', ' of technology, the human is the smarter one,', " but that's beginning to change, 'cause robots", " working together is something that's coming soon.", " They're starting to give information to you.", " At the same time, they're relaying information to", ' their other friends, their other peer robots, saying,', ' "Hey, can you see this?
