['\n\n                        You keep your work station so clean, Jerome. It\'s next to godliness. - Isn\'t that what they say? - "Godliness." I reviewed your flight plan. Not one error in a million keystrokes. Phenomenal. It\'s right that someone like you... is taking u s to Titan. Has the committee approved the mission? There\'s been talk of delay. You shouldn\'t listen to talk. You leave in a week. You\'ve got a substance test. lf you have been notified for substance analysis... please report to the testing center. Never shy. Pisses on command. I ever tell you that\'s a beautiful piece of equipment? Every time I\'m here. Occupational hazard. I see many in the course of any day. Yours happens to be an exceptional example. I don\'t know why my folks didn\'t order one like that for me. By the way... have I told you about my son? - No, you haven\'t. - Remind me to sometime. So you\'re about to go up. One week left. Please tell me you\'re excited. I\'ll tell you at the end of the week. Congratulations, Jerome. Thank you. How many launches are there in a day? A dozen? Sometimes more. You\'re the only one who watches them all. If you\'re going to pretend like you don\'t care, don\'t look up. The most unremarkable of events. Jerome Morrow, navigator first class... is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan... the 14th moon of Saturn. A highly prestigious assignment. Although for Jerome... selection was virtually guaranteed at birth. He \'s blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking. A genetic quotient second to none. No, there is truly nothing remarkable... about the progress of Jerome Morrow. Except that I am not Jerome Morrow. I was conceived in the Riviera. Not the French Riviera, the Detroit variety. They used to say that a child conceived in love... has a greater chance of happiness. They don \'t say that anymore. I\'ll never understand what possessed my mother to put her faith... in God\'s hands rather than those of her local geneticist. Ten fingers, ten toes. That \'s all that used to matter. Not now. Now, only seconds old... the exact time and cause of my death was already know. Neurological condition : Manic depression : Attention deficit disorder: Heart disorder-- Early fatal potential. Life expectancy: 30.2 years. Thirty years. The name? - Anton. - No! Vincent Anton. Yeah. That\'s a good name. I know he\'ll do something. From an early age l came to think of myself as others thought of me. Chronically ill. Every skinned knee and runny nose... was treated like it was life-threatening. I\'m sorry. The insurance won\'t cover it. - If he fell-- - I was told everything-- I wish there was something I could do. Like most parents of their day... they were determined that their next child would be born... in what has become the natural way. Your extracted eggs, Marie... have been fertilized with Antonio\'s sperm. After screening, we are left with two healthy boys... and two very healthy girls. Naturally, no critical predispositions to any major inheritable diseases. All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate. First, we let\'s decide on gender. Have you given it any thought? We would want Vincent to have a brother, you know... to play with. Of course. Hello, Vincent. You have specified hazel eyes, dark hair and fair skin. I\'ve taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions. Premature baldness, myopia... alcoholism and addictive susceptibility... propensity for violence, obesity, etc. We didn\'t want-- Diseases, yes, but-- We were just wondering if it\'s good to leave a few things to chance? You want to give your child the best possible start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection built in already. Your child doesn\'t need any additional burdens. Keep in mind this child is still you. Simply the best of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result. That \'s how my brother, Anton, came into the world. A son my father considered worthy of his name. What did I tell you? See how he\'s grown? By the time we were playing at blood brothers... I understood that there was something different flowing through my veins... and I\'d need more than a drop... if l was going to get anywhere. Our favorite game was chicken. When our parents weren\'t watching, we \'d swim out as far as we dared. It was about who would get scared and turn back first. Come on, you coward ! Of course, it was always me. Anton was by far the stronger swimmer... and he had no excuse to fail. Maybe it was the love of the planets... or my growing dislike for this one. But for as long as l can remember, I have dreamed of going into space. How many astronauts are there? I bet I could be one if I wanted. Don\'t eat that. It\'s Pluto. My goals didn\'t change a lot in the intervening years... much to my parents\' dismay. You have to be realistic. With your heart condition-- Mom, there\'s a chance there\'s nothing wrong with my heart. One in a hundred. - I\'ll take it. - The trouble is, they won\'t. Listen. For God\'s sake... you gotta understand something. The only way you\'ll see the inside of a spaceship is to clean it. My father was right. It didn\'t matter how much I lied on my resume. My real resume was in my cells. Why should anybody invest all that money to train me... when there are a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it\'s illegal to discriminate. "Genoism," it\'s called. But no one takes the law seriously. lf you refuse to disclose... they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake... even the saliva on your application form. lf in doubt, a legal drug test can just as easily become... an illegal peek at your future in the company. You sure you wanna do this? You know you\'re gonna lose. It was the last time we swam together... and out into the open sea... like always, knowing each stroke to the horizon... was one we\'d have to make back to the shore. But something was very different about that day. Every time Anton tried to pull away... he found me right beside him. Until finally, the impossible happened. It was the one moment in our lives that my brother... was not as strong as he believed and l was not as weak. It was the moment that made everything else possible. Like many in my situation... I moved around in the next few years, getting work where l could. I must\'ve cleaned half the toilets in the state. I belonged to a new underclass... no longer determined by social status or skin color. - Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen. - No. We now have discrimination down to a science. There\'s your cleaning material. Start from the front, clean all the way back. And I wanna see my smiling face on that floor. What about you, Your Majesty? You dreaming of space? Come here. You can start by cleaning this space right here. I was never more certain of how far away l was from my goal... than when l was standing right beside it. When you clean the glass, don\'t clean it too well. What do you mean? You might get ideas. But if it\'s clean, it\'ll be easier to see me when I\'m on the other side of it. For all my brave talk, I knew it was just that. No matter how much l trained or how much l studied... the best test score wouldn\'t matter without the blood test to go with it. I made up my mind to resort to more extreme measures. The man who showed up at my doorstep... didn\'t exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages. Stand straight. - How did you hear about me? - People. Any distinguishing marks? Tattoos, scars, birthmarks? No. I don\'t think so. You\'re serious about this? I hope you \'re not wasting my time. No, I\'d give 1 00% . That\'ll get you halfway there. That\'s an old edition, but I know it all by heart. By heart? You realize the commitment is binding. You have somebody? For the genetically superior, success is easier to attain... but is by no means guaranteed. After all, there is no gene for fate. And when, for one reason or another... a member of the elite falls on hard times... their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous. One man\'s loss is another man \'s gain. His credentials are impeccable. An expiration date you wouldn\'t believe. The guy\'s practically gonna live forever. He\'s got an I.Q. off the register. Better than 20/20 in both eyes. And the heart of an ox. He could run through a wall. If he could still run. Actually, he was a big-time swimming star. You could go anywhere with this guy\'s helix tucked under your arm. What did I tell you? You look so right together I wanna double my fee. - We don\'t look anything alike. - It\'s close enough. When was the last time anybody looked at a photograph? You could have my face on your name tag, for Christ\'s sake. - How do I explain the accident? - That\'s the beautiful thing. It happened out of the country. There\'s no record he broke his back. As far as anyone\'s concerned... he\'s still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him clean and fill in the last year of hi s life. You\'re a foreigner. They don \'t care where you were born, just how. Blood has no nationality. As long as it\'s got what they\'re looking for... it\'s the only passport you need. Who lives up there? I certainly don\'t. So began the process of becoming Jerome. Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth. Isn\'t there another way? Surgery\'s no good. They\'ll see the scars. It\'s contact lenses or a white cane. Besides, the color doesn\'t match. He\'s right. My eyes are prettier. You understand I take 25% of everything you make. If it doesn\'t work out, this equipment must be returned within seven days. And you don\'t get your deposit back. - I thought you said 20%. - He told me 20%. - Twenty percent. - It\'s not negotiable. I guess that\'s it. Not quite. - Why? What? - There\'s still the matter of height. - How tall are you? - 4\'6". How tall were you before the accident? Unfortunately, his profile says he\'s 6\'1 ". I\'ll wear lifts. Even with lifts, you\'re not that tall. So, what? We never discussed that. I thought you were serious. I am. I\'m not doing that. I won\'t. Jerome never questioned my commitment again. I took my mind off the pain by reminding myself... that when l eventually did stand up I\'d be two inches closer to the stars. You all right? Yeah. Wanna go dancing? You had to be a right-hander. I guess no one orders southpaws anymore. Jerome Morrow. It\'s a nice name. - It\'s my name. - I can\'t be you without it. What makes you think you can be me at all? Look at this. Look at it. It\'s nice. I\'m impressed. Is it real? Are you colorblind too? - It\'s silver. - So? Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium. With all I had going for me... I was still second best. Me. So how do you expect to pull this off? I don\'t know exactly. Your signature needs work. It soon came time to put our preparations to the test. Jerome was engineered with everything needed to get into Gattaca... except the desire to do so. Do you really wanna be in there? I don\'t wanna be in there. I wanna be up there. What\'s up there? That\'s what I wanna find out, Jerome. Call me Eugene. My middle name. If you\'re gonna be Jerome, you better start getting used to it. Where\'s my sample? In the refrigerator! Door on the left! Which pouch? Oh, any of them. Should I test it? If you like! - What\'s wrong with the machine? - Nothing! It\'s a hot sample. You\'ve been drinking again. - I haven\'t! - Christ, it\'s 8:00 in the morning ! I haven\'t! This is no joke! My interview is in an hour! There is more vodka in this piss than there is piss! I\'m sorry. I had half a glass to celebrate. Try Friday\'s. That one will be okay. - There\'s only Wednesday left. - That\'s the one. Listen. It\'s not too late to back out. This is the last day you\'re gonna be you and I\'m gonna be me. Well? Congratulations. Well, what about the interview? That was it. I got it. Of course you got it. And that\'s the way it was. Daily, l disposed of as much loose skin, fingernails and hair as possible... to limit how much of my In-Valid self I would leave in the Valid world. Meanwhile, Eugene prepared samples of his own superior body matter... so that l might pass for him. Customized urine pouches for the frequent substance tests... fingertip blood sachets for security checks... vials filled with other traces. While Eugene supplied me with a new identity, l paid the rent... and kept him in the style to which he\'d become accustomed. Eugene never suffered from the routine discrimination of a "utero"... \'\'faith birth \'\' or \'\'In-Valid\'\' as we were called. A \'\'Valid, \'\' a \'\'vitro, \'\' a \'\'made man, he suffered under a different burden. The burden of perfection. I was now a member of a relatively new... and particularly detested segment of society. One of those who refuses to play the hand that he was dealt. I am most commonly known as a \'\'borrowed ladder\'\' or... a \'\'de-gene-erate. \'\' In the guise of Jerome Morrow... I have risen quickly through the ranks of Gattaca. Only one of the mission directors has ever come close... to discovering my true identity. Strange to think, he may have more success exposing me in death... than he ever did in life. We apologize for any inconvenience. - I think we can rule out suicide. - Excuse me? Nothing. Thank you. This will take a while. We might have to push things back. Irene, I want you to assist the investigators. My work, Director. That would put me behind. I appreciate your sacrifice. Will you see that I don\'t lose my place in line? Your place is assured. So, will you kindly inform the authorities... that we will cooperate in any way... although we can\'t tolerate a major disruption. - Director-- - Thank you. Thank you. How will this affect the mission? We\'re still going ahead as planned. The launch window\'s only open until week\'s end... and tragic though this event may be... it hasn\'t stopped the planets\' turning, has it? - What happened? - I\'m going up. When? End of the week. That soon? What about the mission director? He\'s dead. Are you serious? He was found in his office today beaten so badly they had to check his name tag. You are serious. So that\'s it. There\'s nothing between us and ignition. I\'m going up. - The man was murdered. - So? I didn\'t do it. I didn\'t say you did, but the place is gonna be crawling with Hoovers. I\'ll take my chances with the "J. Edgars" over the mission director. Besides, what if they do find something? I\'ll be out of their jurisdiction. We have to get drunk immediately. - Good evening, gentlemen. - I hope our table\'s ready. - I understand you\'re leaving us. - Looks that way. - We\'re going to miss you. - You\'ve opened the wine, I hope? - Of course, sir. - Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish. Thank you, sir. How old? - Me? - The specimen. I kissed him five minutes ago. A real good one. I\'ll see what I can do. - You want the full sequence? - Yes. Thank you. Good luck. Some samples may be consumed in the sequencing process. Yes. Quite a catch. How many times have I told Cavendish? This can\'t have been opened more than five minutes ago! A wine like this needs to breathe. Remember that. You know, they say when you\'re weightless... it\'s the closest thing to being in the womb. I can\'t believe you pulled this off. They\'re sending you up there. Up there, for Christ\'s sake. You, of all people. I hate to think of you alone in that room for a year. Don\'t think about it. Anyway... the room I\'m stuck in is bigger than your tin can. You know what I\'m saying. What are you gonna do? I have my books. I go places in my head. - I\'d be happier if you had company. - I have visitors! - None that you don\'t pay. - I wouldn\'t have it any other way. Seriously, what are you gonna do? I\'m gonna finish this. What\'s Titan like this time of year? What\'s Titan like? Titan is exactly like this. All the time. It\'s got a cloud around it so thick nobody can tell what\'s underneath. Maybe there\'s nothing there. There\'s something there. You should be going instead of me. Why? Because up there your legs wouldn\'t matter. I\'m scared of heights. I\'m sorry! Do you want this? I\'ll save some for you, shall l? - I\'m really sorry. - You\'re not that sorry. Don\'t give me a hard time. Give me a break. Come on ! - I\'m sorry. - Help! I wasn\'t drunk. - What do you mean? - When I walked in front of that car. What car? I stepped right out in front of it. I\'d never been more sober in my life. - Go to sleep. - Couldn\'t even get that right. "If at first you don\'t succeed, try, try again." Go to sleep. I\'m proud of you, Vincent. You must be drunk to call me Vincent. - How much do you need? - Twenty minutes. You can go. It\'s all right, Irene. You\'re excused. We found our man. It\'s the only specimen we can\'t account for. Every ten years or so, things go our way. The eyelash? What do you know about him? He\'s an unregistered In-Valid. He was a janitor here until a few years back when he disappeared. So the specimen could have been here since then. Take a look at the floor. Nothing lays around here for very long. And motive? Would a janitor come back to kill a man he never knew? His profile does suggest a violent temperament. If I\'m not mistaken, it also suggests that he\'s a sick man. There\'s a 90%% chance the owner of this eyelash has died of natural causes. Then there\'s a ten percent chance he\'s alive. It\'s a lost-and-found case, sir. We find the man who\'s lost an eyelash, we have the murderer. I\'ll do a cross check, find out about his family-- I\'ve already run it. There\'s no record of any living relative. That\'s a damn shame, sir. Check the entry log, alibis, grudges. I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The mission director was not universally loved. He was leading the cutbacks in the program. With all due respect, sir-- Whatever you say. Jerome, Jerome, the metronome. I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his. Mr. Director, you will be pleased to know we have a suspect. That is a relief. Who is it? We found an unaccounted for specimen in the south wing. Here\'s his picture. - An In-Valid. - We are still following other leads. Be that as it may, I\'m having this posted immediately. I\'m curious. An advantage, I should imagine, in your line of work. Your hiring practices. Our recruitment philosophy. Who do you have to be to be here? Naturally, our standard is beyond that of the common citizen. Even amongst your people, you must have varying levels of excellence. Occasionally we\'ve had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings... but nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field... such as law enforcement, for example. But now there are enough of the right kind of people... to warrant a new measuring stick. Bodies with minds to match. Essential as we push out further and further. Yet you still closely monitor performance. We have to ensure that people are meeting their potential. - And exceeding it. - No one exceeds his potential. If he did? It would simply mean we did not accurately gauge him in the first place. - Are you all right? - Terrific. This is the entry log for the last seven days. What about you? Do you have an alibi? - I was alone. - I find that hard to believe. Excuse me. I\'ll take care of that. I see I\'m not the only one who looks up every time there\'s a launch. - Hello. - Hello. It\'s awful about the director. Awful it didn\'t happen sooner. Didn\'t the director threaten to cancel your mission more than once? - Yes. he did. - Somebody did you a favor. Do they have any idea whose hand I should be shaking? They found an eyelash in the south wing. - Does it have a name? - Just some In-Valid. I had you sequenced. I read your profile. I\'m sorry. Seems you\'re everything they say you are and more. What about you? You\'re engineered just like the rest of us. Not quite. "Un acceptable likelihood of heart failure." I think that\'s what the manual says. The only trip I\'ll take in space is around the sun on the satellite here. If there\'s anything wrong with you, I can\'t see it from here. If you don\'t believe me-- Here. Take it. If you\'re still interested, let me know. I\'m sorry. The wind caught it. Is this the approach path that we discussed? Absolutely, Director. Quite right. Listen to what I\'m saying to you. I want what I ordered. It\'s a completely different color. Now, I\'m bored of talking to you. I\'m bored. I\'ll call you back. That was the company that sent us your hair dye. They sent me \'\'summer wheat" instead of "honey dawn." Any fool knows it\'s two shades lighter. She said. "Why don\'t you try a change?" We can\'t use a change. Now I\'m probably gonna have to pay for the five boxes they\'ve sent me. We can\'t stay here. Idiots I have to deal with, you wouldn\'t believe. They think I killed the mission director. - What makes them think that? - They found my eyelash. Where? In the corridor. Well, it could be worse. They could\'ve found it in your eye. They\'ve got my picture plastered up all over the place. I can\'t turn around without seeing my own face. - They\'ll recognize me. - They won\'t recognize you. I don\'t recognize you ! They won\'t marry the eyelash to you. They won\'t believe that one of their elite... could have suckered them all this time. No, no, no. We change nothing. We do as we planned. You\'re Jerome Morrow. navigator first class. I\'m not Jerome Morrow. I\'m a murder suspect. What are you doing? That\'s more than a day\'s work! - Wait. - We can\'t stay here. Stop that! Oh. fine! You leave if you want, but you\'re not taking that stuff. That stuff is mine! I could\'ve rented myself out to somebody with a spine... if I\'d known you were going to go belly-up on me at the last gasp. You can\'t quit on me now. I\'ve put too much into this. What do you want me to do? Wheel in there and finish the job myself? They\'re going to find me. You still don\'t understand, do you? When they look at you, they don\'t see you anymore. They only see me. Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless? I\'m going out. Where are you going? If I\'m gonna get arrested tomorrow, I\'m gonna go out tonight. - You sure that\'s a good idea? - Well, it was your idea... not to change anything. - Who\'s going? - Just everybody. Everybody. If I don\'t go, it\'ll look suspicious. You don\'t want to look suspicious, do you? Thanks. Who ordered this? What are we doing here? I\'m following a lead. Forgive me, but that\'s what I do. I\'m a detective. I follow leads. What makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here? He\'s an In-Valid, sir. Where do we look for In-Valids but where In-Valids are? He\'s an In-Valid? He\'s an In-Valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years. Do you think he\'s likely to lie down for us now? - Well, what would you suggest? - Move the inquiry... back to the scene. Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca, sweep again, random stops. You\'re a navigator? At Gattaca? That\'s what it says, doesn\'t it? It doesn\'t say you\'re crippled. I\'m not crippled. I hurt my leg training, you moron. How dare you question me? Yeah, right. - What\'s your number? - All right, forget it. What\'s your number, you fucking flatfoot? I said forget it. What do you want, an apology? It gets to you, doesn\'t it? It gets to you that I can do what you can only dream of! I\'m getting off this ball of dirt! How dare you question me? - That\'s harassment. - My mistake. What\'s your number? May I remind you that this is a crime scene? What\'s this man doing here? - What are you doing, old man? - Doing my job, sir. - This is evidence. - But it\'s just trash. You didn\'t know? - Oh, yes. - Wonderful. wasn\'t it? Twelve fingers or one, it\'s how you play. That piece can only be played with 12. What\'s all this about? It\'s probably nothing. You better not. I don\'t want to give you a contaminated specimen. Get my meaning? Thanks. You never know where those swabs have been. I want to show you something. Come on ! We\'ll miss it! Come on. We\'ll miss it. What did I tell you? - Strange. - What? - Your eyes look different. - I guess it must be the light. Must be. Positive match . I\'m impressed. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep? Two samples. Two days. Either the suspect returned to the scene of the crime to get a drink of water... or he still works there. I thought we checked all the service staff. I don\'t think he cleans up the place anymore. I have a feeling he might be there under false pretenses. A borrowed ladder? At Gattaca? It\'s far-fetched, but it\'s not impossible. I find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. He wouldn\'t have the mental faculty or the physical stamina. Maybe you\'re underestimating him. Maybe he is an impostor, and maybe the director found out. That could be his motive. Let\'s sample every internal employee intravenously. Two-thirds of their work force fall under that category. We\'d close them down for days. A fingertip or urine sample is sufficient. I suggest blood from the vein. I hope I\'m not out of line. It\'s only a matter of time, sir. What\'s with the plungers, Lamar? You open up a blood bank? The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned... that my testing methods may have been compromised. - Goddamn ! - I\'m sorry. - Are you out of practice? - Here, let me look at that. It\'s all right. Luckily, it looks as though we have enough. If you need more, you can always get it off his shoes. So you didn\'t do it, after all . I guess somebody beat me to it. I guess. I leave in two days. I guess you know that. But-- That\'s the last. - Something\'s not right. - He\'s not here. No, we missed something. I say we test again. Test? I cannot allow you... to disrupt operations any further. You\'re not concerned about having a murderer in your midst? Right now your presence is creating more of a threat. The window for our latest launch is open for seven days... once every 70 years... so it\'s rather crucial we leave on time. The mission means a great deal to you, doesn\'t it? And your late colleague opposed it, didn\'t he? Take another look at my profile, Detective. You won\'t find a violent bone in my body. My apologies, Director. We won\'t trouble you any further. This is not the only place we can look. Let\'s start making our rounds. I\'m luckier than most. Not as lucky as some. - I know something about that. - You, Jerome? What heart problem did you ever have? Did you get yours broken once? I had this crazy idea... that you were more interested in the murder case than me. You\'re right. That\'s a crazy idea. Would you like to dance? It\'s funny. You work so hard... and you do everything you can to get away from a place... and when you finally get your chance to leave... you find a reason to stay. A year is a long time. Not so long. Just once around the sun. Hello, everyone! I\'m your detective for the evening. Please don\'t leave the premises. I said nobody leave! Am I speaking... in some strange foreign language? Check for hairpieces, lenses, dentures. I want napkins. I want cigarette butts. I want the saliva off teacups. That\'s a familiar face. Check him out, will you? I thought you wanted to dance. - Excuse me. Where are you going? - Yeah. I know. Just a minute. - Are you insane? - Come on ! Where did they go? Come here. Come on. - Don\'t you understand? I can\'t do that. - You just did. Don\'t touch your face! Don\'t swallow! Don\'t spit! Let\'s clean his teeth. Who\'s Vincent? Don\'t say anything. What happened? The scars on your legs? You remember the \'99 Chrysler LeBaron? This is the exact height of the front fender. I looked left instead of right. Did you just make that up, or do you use it all the time? I use it all the time. I know you had something to do with the director\'s death. That\'s not true, Irene. Isn\'t that the man from last night? He\'s nobody. He\'s one of our best. I\'m certain he has nothing to do with this business. You don\'t look well. Jerome. Why don\'t you go home? - Can I help you? - I\'m looking for Jerome Morrow. I\'m sorry. He\'s ill with nausea. It\'s quite common before a mission. Really? I ought to pay him a visit. I understand you can show me the way. You don\'t know who he is, do you? Hello? Eugene, I need you to be yourself for the day. I was never very good at it, remember? The investigators are coming by. I\'m supposed to be sick. So you keep telling me. How long have I got? Not long. I guess he\'s not home. - Hello? - I\'m here to see Jerome Morrow. Yes. that\'s me. Come up. I guess he\'s home. Come in ! Hello, sweetheart. Where\'s my kiss? Good to see you\'re feeling better. Of course. Now that you\'re here. Who\'s your friend? How can I help? It\'s about the director. Oh. Again? - I hope it\'s no trouble. - No. No trouble. Forgive me for not giving you a guided tour. - Couldn\'t we do this another time? - This won\'t take a moment. Maybe he can tell me what I\'ve got. Who were you expecting? - Yes? - We have our man, sir. - You have him? - We have him in custody. I\'ll come right away. How are you, Jerome? Not bad. Jerome. - How the hell did you get up here? - Oh, I could always walk. I\'ve been faking it. - Don\'t touch me! - Listen to me. I don\'t even know who you are. I\'m the same person I was yesterday. I can\'t hear any more of your lies, Jerome. My name is Vincent! I am Vincent Anton Freeman. I\'m a faith birth, de-gene-erate, whatever you want to call it. But I am not a murderer. You\'re a God child? But we do have one thing in common. Only I don\'t have 20 or 30 years left. Mine is already 1 0,000 beats overdue. - It\'s not possible. - You are the authority... on what is not possible, aren\'t you, Irene? They have got you looking so hard for any flaw... that after a while that\'s all that you see. For whatever it\'s worth... I\'m here to tell you that it is possible. It is possible. Congratulations, sir. We did it. His spit was found in the dead director\'s eye. While I was busy obsessing about an eyelash, your instincts... took us in the right direction. So the In-Valid had nothing to do with this? Our friend here acted alone. This mission meant everything to him. Didn\'t it? If they miss this launch window, he won\'t live to see the next one. And since nothing can stop the launch now, he\'s being very cooperative. So I imagine... you\'ll be celebrating tonight, sir. Of course. I think she likes us. Yeah, sure. Just give her a little time. She\'ll get used to the idea. - What was he like? - Who? The cop? - He was just a cop. - Did you catch his name? My name was the topic. Yeah, well, he\'ll be back. They have their man. It\'s over. No, it\'s not over. I have to meet him. My God, you have changed. Don\'t you recognize your own brother? Are we brothers? Our parents both died thinking they\'d outlived you. I had my doubts. What are you doing here, Anton? I should ask you that question. I have a right to be here. You don\'t. You almost sound as if you believe that. I committed no murder. You must be disappointed. You committed fraud. You\'re in trouble. I can get you out of here. Do you have any idea what it took to get in here? You\'ve gone as far as you can go. Come with me now! There is still a few million miles left to go. It\'s over! Is that the only way you can succeed is to see me fail? God! Even you are gonna tell me what I can and can\'t do now! In case you haven\'t noticed, I don\'t need any rescuing. But you did once. Well, you\'ve got all the answers. How do you explain that? You didn\'t beat me that day. I beat myself. Who are you trying to convince? Do you want me to prove it to you? It\'s not important, Anton. It\'s forgotten. Do you want me to prove it to you? I\'ll prove it to you ! I do. Where\'s the shore? - You wanna quit? - We\'re too far out! How are you doing this? How have you done any of this? - We have to go back. - It\'s too late for that. We\'re closer to the other side. What other side? You wanna drown us both? You wanna know how I did it? This is how I did it, Anton. I never saved anything for the swim back. You couldn\'t see, could you? That night, crossing the street. You crossed anyway. If you\'re still interested... Let me know. Sorry. The wind caught it. You\'re flying today, aren\'t you? Look at what a mess you\'re in. Come on. I have your samples ready. I don\'t need any samples where I\'m going. You might when you get back. Everything you need to last you two lifetimes. Why have you done all this? So Jerome will always be here when you need him. - Where are you going? - I\'m traveling too. I don\'t know how to thank you. I got the better end of the deal. I only lent you my body. You lent me your dream. Not until you\'re upstairs. What is this? New policy. Flight got you nervous? Well, there\'s a problem, Lamar. I never told you about my son, did l? He\'s a big fan of yours. Just remember... that I was as good as any and better than most. He wants to apply here. I could\'ve gone up and back, and nobody would\'ve been the wiser. Unfortunately, my son\'s not all that they promised. But then, who knows what he could do? Right? For future reference... right-handed men don \'t hold it with their left. Just one of those things. You\'re gonna miss your flight, Vincent. For someone who was never meant for this world... I must confess I\'m suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star. Maybe I\'m not leaving. Maybe I\'m going home.', '\n                    ']
