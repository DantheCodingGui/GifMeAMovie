['\n\n                        Wait for it. - Can I turn on the radio? - No. Jane, you can\'t keep doing this. The last seventeen occurrences, had been predictable - to the second. - Jane... You\'re an astrophysicist not some storm chaser. I\'m telling you, there\'s a connection, between these atmosphere disturbances and my research. Erik, I... I wouldn\'t have asked you to fly out here, if I wasn\'t absolutely sure. Jane? I think you wanna see this. What is that? God! I thought you said, it was a subtle aurora. Go! Help me get down! - Get closer. - Yeah, right! Good one! Go! What are you doing? I\'m not dying for six college credits! I think that was legally your fault. Get the first aid kit. Do me a favor and dont be dead! Please! Where did he come from? Once... mankind accepted a simple truth, that they were not alone in this universe. Some worlds, man believed to be home to their gods. Others, they knew to fear. From a Realm of cold and darkness, came the Frost Giants. Threatening to plunge the mortal world, into a new ice age. But humanity, would not face this threat alone. Our armies drove the Frost Giants, back into the heart of their own world. The cost was great. In the end, their king fell. And the source of their power, was taken from them. With the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds, and returned home, to the realm eternal... Asgard. And here, we remain as the beacon of hope. Shining out across the stars. And though we have fallen into man\'s myths and legends, it was Asgard, and its warriors, that brought peace... to the universe. But the day will come, when one of you, will have to defend that peace. Do the Frost Giants still live? When I\'m a king... I\'ll hunt the monsters down, and slay them all! Just as you did, Father. A wise king, never seeks out war, but... he must always be ready for it. - I\'m ready, Father. - So am I. Only one of you can ascend to the throne. But both of you, were born to be kings. Oh, please. Yes! Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born. So long entrusted with the mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star. It\'s power has no equal! as a weapon to destroy, or as a tool to build. It is a fit companion for a King. I have defended Asgard, and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms, in the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King... Do you swear to guard the Nine Realms? I swear. And do you swear to preserve the peace? I swear. Do you swear, to cast aside all selfish ambition, and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms? I swear! Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, will proclaim you... The Frost Giants... The Jotuns must pay for what theyve done! They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did it\'s work, the Casket is safe, and all is well. All is well? They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these relics... - But they didnt. - Well, I want to know why? I have a truce with Laufey, King of the Jotun. He just broke your truce! They know you\'re vulnerable. What action would you take? March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so theyll never dare-- try to cross our borders again! Youre thinking only as a warrior! - This was an act of war! - It was the act of but a few, - doomed to fail. - Look how far they got! We will find the breach in our defenses, and it will be sealed. - As King of Asgard... - But you\'re not King! Not yet. Its unwise to be in my company right now, brother. This was to be my day of triumph. It will come. In time. Whats this? If its any consolation, I think youre right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything. If they found a way to penetrate the Asgard defenses once, whos to say they wont try again. Next time with an army. - Exactly! - Theres nothing you can do, without defying Father. No. No, no, no, no, no. I know that look! Its the only way to ensure the safety of our borders. - Thor, Its madness. - Madness? What sort of madness? Were going to Jotunheim. What? This isnt like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder, and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim. My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket. We would just be looking for answers. It is forbidden! My friends, have you forgotten all that weve done together? Fandral, Hogun? Who led you into the most glorious of battles? You did. And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent, you thought youd died and gone to Valhalla? - You did. - Yes. And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that-- a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors, this Realm has ever known? - I did. - True. But I supported you, Sif. My friends, Were going to Jotunheim. Leave this to me. Good Heimdall... You\'re not dressed warmly enough. I\'m sorry? Do you think that you can deceive me? - You must be mistaken... - Enough! Heimdall, may we pass? Never has an enemy slipped my watch, until this day. I wish to know how that happened. Then tell no one where weve gone, until weve returned. Understand? What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead? Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath, to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. And youll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim. Couldnt you just leave the bridge open for us? To leave the bridge open, would unleash the full power of the Bifrost, and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it. - I have no plans to die today. - None do. We shouldnt be here. Let\'s move. Where are they? Hiding. As cowards always do. You\'ve come a long way to die Asgardians. I am Thor Odinson. We know who you are. How did your people get into Asgard? The house of Odin is full of traitors. Do not dishonor my fathers name with your lies! Your father is a murderer and a thief. And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it! You\'re nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man. This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered. Know your place, brother... You know not what your actions would unleash. I do. Go now, while I still allow it. We will accept your most gracious offer. Come on, brother. Run back home, little princess. Damn! Next! At least make it a challenge for me! Thats more like it! Dont let them touch you! Thor! - We must go! - Then go! Run! Thor! Heimdall! Open the bridge! Father! Well finish them together! Silence! Allfather. You look weary. Laufey. End this now. Your boy sought this out. Youre right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can end this, here and now. before theres further bloodshed. We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. Hell get what he came for... war and death. So be it. Why did you bring us back? Do you realize what youve done? What youve started? I was protecting my home. You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Get him to the healing room! Now! There wont be a kingdom to protect, if youre afraid to act! The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you. Thats pride and vanity talking, Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything Ive taught you? - What of a warriors patience? - While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us. The old ways are done. Youd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls! Youre a vain, greedy, cruel boy! And you are an old man and a fool! Yes. I was a fool, to think you were ready. - Father. - Nay! Thor Odinson... You have betrayed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you\'ve opened these peaceful Realms, and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war! You are... unworthy of these Realms! unworthy of your title! You\'re unworthy... of the loved ones, you have betrayed. I now take from you, your power! In the name of my father! And his father before! I, Odin Allfather, cast you out! Whosoever holds of this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. I think that was legally your fault. Get the first aid kit. Do me a favor and dont be dead. Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I totally know CPR. Where did he come from? - You all right? - Hammer! Hammer! Yeah, we can tell youre hammered. Thats pretty obvious. Oh, my God! Erik, look at this. Weve got to move quickly before this all changes. Jane, we have to take him to the hospital. - Father! - Hes fine, look at him. Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost! Hospital. You go, I\'ll stay. You! What Realm is this? Alfheim? Nornheim? New Mexico! You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon! What? He was freaking me out. Next time you decide to taser someone, make sure he\'s already in the car, okay? Jane, come on. - Name? - He said it was "Thor". T-H-O-R. - And your relationship to him? - Ive never met him before. - Until she hit him with the car. - I grazed him. - But she tasered him. - Yes, I did. Hi. Just taking a little blood. How dare you attack the son of Odin! - I need some help! - You need help? Call security! Security to ER! We need assistance! Youre no match for the mighty... Huh. You dont think this was just a magnetic storm, do you? Look. The lensing around these edges, is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. A what? I thought you were a science major. - Political Science. - She was the only applicant. An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection, between two different points of space-time. It\'s a wormhole. Erik, look... What do you see? - Stars. - Yeah. But not our stars. See, this is the star alignment, for our quadrant, this time of year. And unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... these are someone elses constellations. Hey, check this out. No, it can\'t be. I think I left something at the hospital. Its not possible. - Oh, what the hell happened? - I don\'t wanna know. I just lost my most important piece of evidence. Typical. - Now what? - We find him. Did you see what he did in there? I\'m not sure finding him is the best idea. Well, our data can\'t tell us-- what it was like to be inside that event, and he can. So, we\'re gonna find him. Okay. So you\'re gonna look all over New Mexico, right? Exactly. Oh, what? Im so sorry. I swear Im not doing this on purpose! # If you got a problem, you don\'t care what it is # # you\'ll need a hand, I can assure you this. # # I can help. # # I got two strong arms, I can help. # # It would sure do me good # # to do you good Let me help # Come on, pick it in now! Did it work? Sir... weve found it. You know, for a crazy, homeless person, he\'s pretty cut. Hey, sorry I tased you! Excuse me, excuse me! - Umm. - What is this? Oh... My ex. Good with patience and bad with relationships. Uh... They\'re the only clothes I had that would fit you. - They will suffice. - You\'re welcome. This mortal form has grown weak. I need sustenance! We should never have let him go. There was no stopping him. At least hes only banished, not dead. Which is what wed all be if that guard, hadnt told Odin where wed gone. How did the guard even know? I told him. What? I told him to go to Odin after wed left. He should be flogged for taking so long. We should have never reached Jotunheim. - You told the guard? - I saved our lives. And Thors. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did. Loki... you must go to the Allfather, and convince him to change his mind! And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. Hes arrogant, hes reckless, hes dangerous! You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? He may speak of the good of Asgard, but hes always been jealous of Thor. We should be grateful to him. He saved our lives. Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard. Lokis always been one for mischief, but youre talking about something else entirely. Stop! - Am I cursed? - No. What am I? Youre my son. What more than that? The Casket wasnt the only thing, you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? No. In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the Temple, and I found a baby. Small for a giants offspring, abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufeys son. Laufeys son... Yes. Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me? - You were an innocent child. - No. You took me for a purpose, what was it? Tell me! I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace, - ... through you. - What? But those plans no longer matter. So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me. Why do you twist my words? You could have told me what I was from the beginning. - Why didnt you? - You are my son. I wanted only to protect you from the truth. What? Because I...I...I... I\'m the monster that parents tell their children about at night? - Dont... - You know, it all makes sense now! Why you favored Thor all these years. Because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a Frost Giant, sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Guards! Guards, please help! How\'d you get inside that cloud? Also how could you eat an entire box of Pop Tarts, and still be this hungry? This drink, I like it. - I know, it\'s great, right? - Another! Sorry, Izzy. Little accident. - What was that? - It was delicious. I want another. Well, you could have just said so! - I just did. - No. I mean ask nicely. I meant no disrespect. All right. Well, no more smashing. Deal? - You have my word. - Good. The usual, please, Izzy. You missed all the excitement out at the crater. Theyre saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert. Yeah, we were having a good time with it, Untill the Feds showed up. Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash? Yeah. Oh, my God! This is going on Facebook. Smile! What did it look like, the satellite? Well, I dont know nothing about satellites. But it was heavy. Heavy. Nobody could lift it. They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it. - Which way? - Oh. Fifty miles west of here. But I wouldn\'t waste my time. Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left! - Where are you going? - Fifty miles west of here. - Why? - To get what belongs to me. - Oh, so you own a satellite now? - It\'s not what they say it is. Well, what ever it is, the government seems to think it\'s theirs. So, you just intend to go in there and take it? Yes. If you take me there now, Ill tell you everything you wish to know. - Everything? - Yes. All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Myeu-muh? Whats Myeu-muh? Can I have a word, Jane? Please dont do this. You saw what I saw last night. This is no coincidence. We have to find out what\'s in that crater. But I\'m not talking about the crater. I\'m talking about him. - But he\'s promising us answers. - Hes delusional! Listen to what he\'s saying. He\'s talking about Mjolnir, and Thor and Bifrost! It\'s the stories I grew up with as a child. I\'m just gonna drive him. That\'s it! He\'s dangerous, Jane. I\'m sorry. But I can\'t take you. Then this is where we say goodbye. Uh... Thank you! Jane Foster, Erik Selvig, Darcy. Farewell. Alright. Back to work. Hey! Thats my stuff! What the hell is going on here? Ms. Foster, Im Agent Coulson, with SHIELD. Is that suppose to mean something to me? - You cant do this! - Jane. Jane. This is a lot more serious than you realize. Let it go. Let it go? This is my life! Were here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your records, and all your atmospheric data. By "appropriate" you mean "steal"? Here. This should more than compensate you for your trouble. I cant just buy replacements of RadioShack! I made most of this equipment myself! Then Im sure you can do it again. And Im sure I can sue you, for violating my constitutional rights! I\'m sorry, Ms. Foster. But were the good guys. So are we! I\'m on the verge of understanding something extraordinary. And everything I know about this phenomenon, is either in this lab, or in this book, and you can\'t just take this with... - Hey! - Jane! Easy! Easy! Thank you for your cooperation. Years of research, gone. They even took my iPod. - What about the backups? - They took our backups. They took the backups of our backups. They were extremely thorough. Just downloaded like thirty songs onto there. Could you please, stop with your iPod! Who are these people? I knew this scientist. a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and... he wasn\'t heard from again. They\'re not gonna do that to us. - I\'m gonna get everything back. - Come on, please! Let me contact one of my colleagues. He\'s had some dealings with these people before. Ill email him and maybe he can help. They took your laptop, too. All-Father, we must speak with you urgently! My friends. Where\'s Odin? Father has fallen into the Odinsleep. Mother fears he may never awaken again. We would speak with her. She has refused to leave my father\'s bedside. You can bring your urgent matter to me. Your King. My King, we would ask that you end Thor\'s banishment. My first command can not be to undo the Allfathers last. Were on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people need a sense of continuity, in order to feel safe in these difficult times. All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard. Yes, of course. Good, then you await for my word. If I may, beg the indulgence of your majesty, - to perhaps reconsider... - We\'re done! I need a horse! We don\'t have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds. Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. Hey, you still need a lift? I\'ve never done anything like this before. Have you ever done anything like this before? Many times. But you\'re brave to do it. Well, they just stole my entire life\'s work. I don\'t really have much left to lose. - But you\'re clever. - Thanks. Far more clever than anyone else on this Realm. Realm? Realm? - You think me strange? - Yeah, I do. Good strange, or bad strange? I\'m not quite sure yet. I\'m sorry. But who are you? Really? You\'ll see soon enough. You promised me answers. What you seek, it\'s a bridge. Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge? More like a rainbow bridge. God, I hope you\'re not crazy. I never get used to seeing him like this. But hes put it off for so long now. But I fear... - How long will it last? - I don\'t know. This time, it\'s different. We were unprepared. So why did he lie? He kept the truth from you, so that you would never feel different. You are our son, Loki. And we your family. We mustn\'t lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. What hope is there for Thor? There\'s always a purpose to everything your father does. This tube is a satellite crash? If they would\'ve hauled the wreckage away, they wouldn\'t built a city around it. - Youre going to need this. - What? Wait, why? Now stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return the items they\'ve stolen from you. - Deal? - No! Look whats down there! You think you\'re just gonna walk in, - grab our stuff, and walk out? - No. I\'m gonna fly out. Sir, feed from the keyhole. Can barely penetrate the cloud cover. Techs barely working as it is, with all the interference, that things giving off. And weve got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us, Southwest Airlines Flight 5434. Reroute it, like all the others. Hold a sec... we\'ve got something outside the fence, west side. DeLancey, Jackson, west side perimeter, go check it out. DeLancey, Jackson, report. Agent down! Weve got a perimeter breach! Youve reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. Hi, Erik. It\'s me. Don\'t worry, I\'m fine. But... just in case you dont hear from me in the next hour, just come by the crater site and try to find me, okay? I did exactly what you told me not to. I\'m sorry. I\'m so sorry. Bye! - You two, follow me! - All the squad, move! Open the gate! He breached our tunnel! Negative, negative! Place is locked on! I need eyes up high. With a gun. Pulling North! So, what have we got? There\'s a mass of electromagnetic surge coming of that thing. Systems are barely coping. Barton. Talk to me. Do you want me to slow him down, sir? Or you\'re sending in more guys for him to beat up? I\'ll let you know. Youre big. Fought bigger. You better call it Coulson, cause I\'m starting to root for this guy. - Last chance, sir! - No, wait! I wanna see this. Why?! Alright, shows over. Ground units, move in. He committed a crime! He\'s in jail! - I can\'t just leave him there! - Why? - You didn\'t see what I saw! - Look! Look! It\'s Myeu-muh. - Where\'d you find this? - The children\'s section. I just wanted to show you how silly his story was. But you\'re the one who\'s always pushing me, to chase down every possibility, every alternative! I\'m talking about science, not magic! Well magic\'s just science that we don\'t understand yet, - Arthur C. Clarke. - Who wrote science fiction. - A precursor to science fact! - In some cases, yes. Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, then there\'s something on the other side. And advanced beings could have crossed it! Oh, Jane... A primitive culture like the vikings ... might have worshiped them as deities. Yes, yes, exactly! Thank you! You made my men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops. That\'s hurtful. In my experience, it takes someone who\'s received similar training, to do what you did to them. Why don\'t you tell me, where you received your training? Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? You know, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. Where was it? South Africa? Certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you. Who are you? One way or another we\'ll find out what we need to know. We\'re good at that. Don\'t go anywhere. Loki? what are you doing here? I had to see you. What\'s happened? Tell me? Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to father. Father is dead. What? Your banishment. The threat of a new war. It was too much for him to bear. You mustn\'t blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn\'t listen. So cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now. Can I come home? The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile. Yes, but... couldn\'t we find a way to... Your mother, has forbidden your return. This is goodbye, brother. I\'m so sorry. No. I am sorry. Thank you for coming here. Farewell. Goodbye. Goodbye? I just got back. Sir... hes got a visitor. - His name is Donald Blake? - Doctor Donald Blake. You have dangerous co-workers, Doctor Selvig. He was distraught when he found out, that you\'d taken all of our research. That was years of his life, gone! You can understand how a man can go off like that. A big faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and... That\'s how he put it. That still doesn\'t explain, how he managed to tear through our security. Steroids! He\'s a bit if a fitness nut. Sir? It says here that he was an M.D. Well, he is! Or he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. A brilliant physicist. He\'s a... he\'s a wonderful man. He\'s a man in pain. Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Its gonna be all right, Im taking you home, now. Doctor Selvig? Just keep him away from the bars. I will. - Where are we going? - To get a drink. Follow them. You know, I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Was that a bad thing, finding out that you don\'t have all the answers? You start asking the right questions. For the first time in... in my life, I have no idea what I\'m supposed to do. Anyone who\'s ever going to find his way in this world, has to start by admitting, he doesn\'t know where the hell he is. Thank you, for what you\'ve done. No, don\'t thank me. I only did it for Jane. Her father and I taught at University together. He was a good man. He never listened. Neither did I. My father was trying to teach me something. But I was too stupid to see it. I don\'t know if you\'re delusional, or if you\'re putting some kind of con. I don\'t care. I just care about her. I\'ve seen the way she looks at you. I swear to you, I mean her no harm. Good. In that case, I\'ll buy you another round. And you\'ll leave town tonight. Two boilermakers! Kill him. After all I\'ve done for you? So you\'re the one who showed us the way into Asgard. That was just a bit of fun really. To ruin my brother\'s big day. And to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer. I will hear you. I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into Odin\'s chambers and you can slay him where he lies. Why not kill him yourself? I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly to a King, who had murdered his predecessor. Once Odin is dead, I will return the casket to you. And you can return Jotunheim to all it\'s uh... glory. I... accept. What troubles you, Gatekeeper? I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see you or hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants had entered this Realm. Perhaps your senses have weakened, after your many years of service. Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide, that which he does not wish me to see. You have great power, Heimdall. Did Odin ever fear you? - No. - And why is that? Because he is my King. And I\'m sworn to obey him. He was your King. And you are sworn to obey me now. Yes? Yes. Then you\'ll open the Bifrost to no one. Until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done. Oh, my God! Is he okay? Hes fine. Not injured at all. - I\'m Sorry, my friend. - What happened? We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud. Put him on the bed. Oh, I still dont think youre the God of Thunder. But you ought to be. Are these your chambers? Uh... its more of a temporary living situation. Oh, I\'m sorry. I dont usually have guests. Actually... We never had guests. That\'s not the right place for it. I\'m so sorry. - Can we go outside? - Yes, of course. I come up here sometimes when I can\'t sleep, or when I\'m trying to reconcile particle data, or when Darcy\'s driving me crazy. I come up here a lot actually, now that I think about it. I\'m really glad you\'re safe. You\'ve been very kind to me. I have been far less grateful than you deserve. Well, I hit you with my car a couple times, so I think that kind of even things out. Perhaps I had it coming. Oh, my God! - I don\'t believe it! - It was all I could get back. I\'m sorry, it\'s not as much as I promised. No! No! This is great! This is... I don\'t have to start from the scratch now. Thank you. What\'s wrong? SHIELD, whatever they are. They\'re going to do everything in their power, to make sure this research never sees the light of day. No, Jane. Listen to me, you must not give up. You must finish what you started. - Why? - Because you\'re right. Here, look. You\'re ancestors called it magic, and you call it science. Well, I come form a place, where they\'re one and the same thing. What is that? My father, explained it to me like this, that your world is one of the Nine Realms of the cosmos. Linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil. The worlds tree. Now you see it everyday without realizing. The images glimpsed through, what did you call it? This... this hooble telescope. - Hubble. - Hubble telescope. Tell me more. So, the Nine Realms. Now there is Midgard, which is earth. There\'s Alfheim, Vanaheim, Jotunheim and Asgard. And that\'s were I come from. Thank you, Jane. Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, Yet you\'ve managed to consume, four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef and two casks of ale! Shame on you! Don\'t you care! Do not mistake my appetite for apathy! Stop it! Both of you! Stop. We all know what we have to do. We must go. We must find Thor. - It\'s treason. - To hell with treason. It\'s suicide. Thor would do the same for us. Now, shh! Heimdall might be watching. Heimdall demands your presence. Were doomed. You would defy the commands of Loki, our King, Break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? - Yes. - Good! So you\'ll help us? I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the bridge to you. - Complicated fellow, isn\'t he? - Now what do we do? Look! What the hell was that? I dont know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, and then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest. Lets go take a look. - Thank you. - Thank you. You\'re very welcome. Base to team two, we\'ve got activity outside the town. Stay on your target. Ensure my brother does not return! Destroy everything! Mom? Is there a Renaissance Faire in town? - Call it in. - Yeah. Base, we\'ve got... Xena, Jackie Chan, and Robin Hood It\'s a beautiful theory, Jane. You won\'t be able to convince... the scientific community of any of it. Not without hard evidence. Found you! My friends! This is good! This is good! - I don\'t believe it! - Oh, excuse me. Lady Sif, and the warriors three. My friends, I have never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come. We\'re here to take you home! You know I can\'t go home. My father is... dead because of me. I must remain in exile. Thor... your father still lives. Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard? You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm? There are secret paths between the worlds, to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king. And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper. And no longer citizen of Asgard. Then I need no longer obey you. Get somebody from Linguistics down here. Was somebody else coming? - Is that one of Starks? - I don\'t know. That guy never tells me anything. Hello! Youre using unregistered weapons technology. Identify yourself. Here we go. Incoming! Jane, you have to leave. - What are you gonna do? - I\'m staying here. Thor is gonna fight with us. My friends, I\'m just a man. I\'ll only be in the way, or worse get one of you killed. But I can help get these people to safety. Well, if you\'re staying, then so am I. - We\'ll need some time. - You\'ll have it. Okay, move it people! Everybody, out! Use the backdoor! Go, hurry! You can eat later! Keep it distracted. For Asgard!! Fall back! Go, now! Run! Sif, you\'ve done all you can. No! I will die a warrior\'s death. Stories will be told of this day. Live, and tell those stories yourself. Now, go! You must return to Asgard. You have to stop Loki. What about you? Dont worry, my friends. I have a plan. Come on. We need to fall back. Come on! Come on. Wait! What\'s he doing? Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am truly sorry. But these people are innocent. Taking their lives will gain you nothing. So take mine... and end this. No! - It\'s over. - No. It\'s not over. - I mean, you\'re safe. - We\'re safe. It\'s over. No. No. Whosoever holds of this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. Jane! - No. No. - Let\'s go! Now! No! Oh. My. God. So is this how you normally look? More or less. It\'s a good look. We must go to the Bifrost site. I would have a word with my brother. Excuse me! Donald, I don\'t think you\'ve been completely honest with me. Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause, the protection of this world. From this day forward you can count me as your ally, if, you return the items you have taken from Jane. - Stolen! - Borrowed. Of course you can have your equipment back. You\'re gonna need it to continue your research. Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of? Uh... sure. Wait! I need to debrief you! Welcome to Asgard. Heimdall! Open the Bifrost! Heimdall. Heimdall. He doesn\'t answer. Then were stranded. Heimdall! If you can hear me, we need you now! Heimdall! we need you now! Heimdall! I must go back to Asgard. But I give you my word, I will return for you. Deal? Deal. Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me. It\'s said, you can still hear and see what transpires around you. I hope it\'s true. So that you may know, your death came at the hand... of Laufey. And your death came by the son of Odin. Loki, you saved him. I swear to you mother, that they will pay for what they have done today. Loki! Thor! I knew you\'d return to us. Why don\'t you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends! - To kill me! - What? Well, I must have been enforcing father\'s last command. You\'re a talented lier, brother. Always have been. It\'s good to have you back. Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim. You can\'t stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart. Jane? Why have you done this? To prove to father, that I am a worthy son! When he wakes, I will have saved his life. I will have destroyed that race of monsters. And I will be true heir to the throne! You can\'t kill an entire race! Why not? And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You? who could have killed them all with your bear hands. - I\'ve changed. - So have I. Now, fight me. I never wanted the throne! I only ever wanted to be your equal. I will not fight you, brother! I\'m not your brother. - I never was! - Loki, this is madness! Is it madness? Is it? Is it? Come on, what happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don\'t tell me it was that woman? Oh! It was! Well, maybe when we\'re finished here, I\'ll pay here a visit myself! Thor! Brother, please! Enough! Look at you. The mighty Thor! With all your strength! And what good does it do you now? Do you hear me, brother? There\'s nothing you can do! What are you doing? If you destroy the bridge, youll never see her again! Forgive me, Jane. I could have done it, father! I could have done it! For you! For all of us! No, Loki. Loki, no! No. It\'s gone. And then, with a mighty bellow, I flew into the giant metal beast and laid it low... Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge... As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. My Queen, I\'m so sorry for your loss. How is he? He mourns for his brother. And... he misses her. The mortal. You\'ll be a wise king. There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father. I have much to learn. I know that now. But some day, perhaps, I shall make you proud. Youve already made me proud. So, earth is lost to us? No. There is always hope. Can you see her? Yes. I have the particle detectors. Darcy, do you have the SHIELD\'s satellite codes? Yeah. Have you seen my taser? How is she? In the car. Come on, Jane. She searches for you. Doctor Selvig? So, you\'re the man behind all this? It\'s quite a labyrinth. I was thinking, they\'re taking me down here to kill me. I\'ve been hearing about the New Mexico situation. Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than I am. I have a lot to work with. The Forster theory, a gate to another dimension. It\'s unprecedented. Isn\'t it? Legend tells us one thing, history another. But every now and then, we find something that belongs to both. What is it? Power, doctor. If we can figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power. Well, I guess that\'s worth a look. Well, I guess that\'s worth a look.', '\n                    ']
